I've been playing for years now and it's been quite addictive.... But can u the developers just plss fix the issue of I not seeing enemies at far distances which always makes me vulnerable to surprise attacks.... And also I've always had the privilege in past to play with high frame rate but now it's only low frame rate I can use to play which's depressing....,4
"An annoying experience all round. Ever since the update for season 4 ( wild dogs). I have been unable to enjoy a game without the game running like a cracked CD. For the interests of the player and developer, I suggest you reverse whatever "" upgrade "" was done. Don't forget that when you continually buff up the storage size of games and run time, the phones remain the same. I must not necessarily have a high end thousand dollar devices to play your game.",1
"I love the game though. It's close to real, but the greatest problem is the consistent upgrades with very large storage taken. It reduces the functionality of the game. One would think that after all that, the game should be offline but it's frustratingly online. The developers have to reconsider, if not their players may drop over a period of time due to the games over capacity. Also noticed that the developers don't respond to people's reviews which means the care less about it. Look into it.",3

COD happens to be my best mobile game but with each update it becomes less enjoyable largely due to the game lagging. Once I get shot at the game freezes and the next thing I know is game over. This happens mostly when on BR mode. Kindly help resolve this because it's taking the fun out of the game for me and I'm sure there are a lot more people experiencing this issue.,2
"Codm is awesome and I can guarantee is the best shooting game you can ever played. I've been playing this awesome game since season 1. But the only problem is that the file is getting more and more. Imagine 16.4GB in all total download, and you can't even enjoyed if you have 4GB ram phone because the game is too large. And the purchase is really expensive!. Anything from that is totally awesome. I really recommend this.",5
"Easy y 3 stars, I would give it a 4 star but nope, the BR should be based on reality, the idea of getting shot or shoot while in water is helpful but not needful, then a vehicle, when i decide to shoot the tire of a vehicle it should deflate instead of the whole vehicle exploding it's not fun. And the most annoying part if when there is a new update, I don't understand why we have to redownload every camo for guns and car, audio and soldier, if it's a new map it's ok. Pls read and try to fix.",3
"Wonderful concept and graphics; gameplay 10 outta 10; interactivity is seamless; community and connectivity superb. Just one issue with me- too many updates! I mean the amount of times you need to update this game in a year is frustrating as heck; as I type, I'm updating the app yet again for exciting new content, but with the drawback of needing to restore all my previous content. If Activision could do something about this, this app would be a guaranteed 5. Thanks for the hardwork thoughüëç",4
"I'm simply in love with this game. The graphics are good, never boring thanks to the events. Also there was the nerf of persistence that made the modes hardpoint and domination playable again. The only problem I have, since the last update of season 5, is the ping issue: sometimes during a match, much more often when I enter a gunfight, my ping flies from 30ms to 100ms, making me lose the gunfight. But overall I highly recommend downloading it for one of the best mobile experiences.",5
"Reminds me of the old CoD. The option to use a PS5/XBO remote control for Bluetooth linkage to your mobile device is amazing. It's accurate and I can use my phones mirror app to play on the big screen. I have only one minor complaint.. When you hook up a controller, sometimes my opponents do not have controllers even though the game boasts that it will match you with others who are also using controllers. It's a little unfair during off-peak hours. Still a 5 star game!",5
"I love this game right? It's awesome, you don't have to pay ¬£60 to play it, But it's starting to become unplayable, it's not anything about the space or anything, my phone that I use is really good but I'm facing prominent lag issues when my setting were high, I've now reduced them but it's still annoying for when I'm in a ranked game, they also need to sort out the matchmaking cos I'm getting sick of enemy teams being godly, while my team's can barely co-ordinate where they are going. 4 stars..",5
"I really, really love this! It takes up space on your phone but what do expect? Its a call of duty game. Its going to take up space. If you have a low end phone it may take up all/most of your space but its ok its worth it :D! But it may be really laggy. And they give you the choice to lower your graphics! Overall, this is a GREAT game, but please make zombies a permanent thing please then this would be a 50 star out of 10!",5
"I love this app, sometimes you get good players on the enemy team witch is fun, until you lose üòÖ. But the maps are a little hard to learn, but I'm getting the hang of it. In other words this app is so freaking awesome. And is better than stationary game consoles. 10/10 rating. Best game EVER!!!üòÜüòÜ. Although i would love to see ""play vs AI"" offline",5
"I've played lots of times with my PS4 controller, no problem until this new update will not let me use it. All the controls are different and most doesn't work...my controller is brand new. Edit: it's been fixed. Thank you. I love playing, too bad it doesn't work on my brand new Tablet without the sd card. Can't connect to wifi with the game.",5
Gameplay is smooth and there are alot of maps for mp. Once you've reached master 1 in ranked you can't find any matchs. The removal of classic zombies was a huge mistake. I paid for Call of duty black ops zombies when it came out and you can't even play that anymore. Either release classic zombies for good or put it in its own game. People would be more than happy to pay to have all the classic zombie maps at their finger tips.,2
"6/3/2022 update. Glad to see the overhaul on fixing alot of bugs, even more happy there is PS4 controller support again. I can plug my phone into the TV more like a console now. Only issue... You cannot navigate menus with the controller, it is ""in battle"" use only, so after each match I still have to use the phone physically. If the touchpad on the PS4 controller was supported by the game it would be awesome. Keep up the good work!",4
"I've had my ups and downs about the game and game play. Over all I do enjoy it a lot still with over the countless of times of redownloading it trying it out. For the past 2 seasons I've played. I really have been enjoying it. Zombies was the game mode that made it fun again. Wish they would bring it back. I love the game still,",5
"I love the game, it's just not realistic with some of the weapons or features that players have. For instance being able to be in visible with the poltergeist feature or the trickster or flying around. Also some of the weapons are no where close to being realistic like real world weapons. Also I think there's some cheating going on, you shoot an enemy with several rounds and then they turn around and kill you with one shot, not very realistic.",3
"Amazing game, great controls, excellent graphics for a mobile game. My main gripe, and the reason I give 4 stars instead of 5, is that on a weekly basis they do a ""24/7"" version of some stage where you only play that stage if you choose that option. That's fine, except while trying to play MP outside of that mode you still get repeatedly pulled into whatever stage it is so they can fill their playlists quicker. I don't want 4 out of 5 matches in Shipment when I'm not in Shipment 24/7.",4
"Aside from the UN-lucky draws, where I end up spending more money on things I don't want, in hopes of actually being lucky. And the occasional glitch here and there, this is probably one of the most complete fps mobile games I've played. Albeit, this recent update has me logging in, then the game begins to load, and it just freezes, this is a problem I've never had with recent updates. Overall I'd suggest keeping zombie mode, and just charging a flat rate for skins, gun's, new character's.",3
"I haven't played video games in about 10 years, but this brings back those old days on PS2 playing Call of Duty. I didn't know a phone could handle this type of game and have fallen back into playing at least daily. Controls are a little funny but once you get used to them it is easy. I am amazed i can still pull off a 50k/<2d session. The game mode battle Royale is sweet, I was intimidated at first, but it's become my favorite.",5
"This game is amazing . But i have recently started facing off against a serious problem where i am completely unable to enter the game . I forgot to create an account for saving up progression but this issue erased everything i had in the game . This even happens when i have a clean and good internet connection set up but the system continously alerts by saying , "" Timeout "". I just checked the reviews and it seems like many other players are in the same situation as me . Pls fix this ASAP .",3
"Game is good overall However in mp it feels like i get so much dsync to the point where it doesn't matter if i get to cover in time because i would die anyway from the enemies pov. Br is another story, the enemies half the time dont even Render in no more and playing it at low graphics doesn't help either, ""oh why dont you just change the graphics quality in the settings"", yeh if only they Let me make the changes myself and not lock me to one specific option.(atleast let me play br at 60fps)",3
"favorite game on my phone just a couple of things. The game has too many load screens and this affects the playability, when you just want to get to the next game and you have to skip 5 screens to get to the match results it's kind of frustrating and the lag sometimes makes it impossible to play. I'm just trying to find something to complain about just to be able justify the 4 star. I fell like there is something small this game is missing or lacking, but over all it's a fun exiting experience.",4
Awesome and fun the only bad thing is that it's a very large file to have on a phone or whatever and takes up alot of space. Its very worth it though and I've really enjoyed it. If you haven't downloaded this your missing out. There is a few times where the shots are not 100% correct. A example is say you shoot above a person there is times where it says you did a head shot. It's not all the time and my only other complaint is buying items. It's way more expensive alot of items cost to much!!!,5
"Overall is excellent, just as good as playing on a console! Probably the best FPS app you can have on your phone. Only a few gripes. Needs more maps, especially some of the classic popular ones such as Sideshow and Ruins. Give us a campaign mode! Also takes up too much storage space. Still crashes too often. And we should have the option to later get any skins we want, and exchange skins we don't want with new ones.",5
"It's fun. Graphics and overall performance is smooth. Controls are easy once you get the hang of it (you can fully customize it to suit your playing style). Voice chat can be frustrating, I have to keep it disabled for almost all games because sound gets duplicated or someone has some annoying music playing in the background.",5
"Over all great! I love it. Only problem I have is glitching. Rarely happens but when it does it makes it hard to play. And I just got penalized for leaving a game I never left (it was glitching) and was deducted points. I tried going to the help but there is no way to speak with them. So I'm bringing it here. Hope they and a true support line and fix the glitching (that happens rarely but when it does and causes you to get penalized, it's frustrating). Otherwise, I would have given 5‚≠ê.",5
"This game is amazing. Earlier issue was resolved immediately due to self-stupidity. The customization of guns is so fun, and I love the rotating meta weapons each season. I just wish there were less loadouts, like 5-8. I will make one, but then never use it, and it just takes up space. It would be a minor change, but it would help me and others out a bit",5
"Great game overall. I would like a couple of improvements. I would love Zombies to return and with maps such as Kino and Five. I would also love Headquarters, which is like Hardpoint but once a team gains control, when they get killed they must wait until the other team regains control of the area. This adds an extra layer of excitement, especially when one player is tasked to defend as much as possible against a team of 5. Please consider these!!",5
"Awesome game. Gameplay and mechanics are excellent. There are only two problems I have with this game. One of them being that the game is not properly optimized for 2gb ram phones especially with battle royale. The second problem started recently where I would timeout whenever I log in to my account and whenever I touch anything in main menu it would say waiting. Other than that, the game is really enjoyable to play",4
"Freaking phenomenal mate.graphics are on point button layout easy, I think overall this is an excellent mobile game. The only thing that I would ask for you to fix would definitely be the laging in the very beginning of the match I don't know if its just me that it's happening to but every time in the count down at 0 i lag for a good 2 seconds which allows the enemy to get a head start to get in a good position. But yeah keep up the good work great game love it.üíØ",5
This game has a lot of storage and it's not bad and most people play this game cause there is so much storage. Thank you for Making call of duty game. I love it so much but can you please make it more realistic cause if I shoot. It doesn't bleed when I shoot. And If I have a RPG. I shoot someone and it doesn't lose the players hands legs and face. Can you please make it more realistic if the next season comes.,5
"I love the game, had been playing since its launch. The operator skills are added spices which make the gameplay very challenging 'coz you never know what your enemy skills are, for your surprise. But since the last season, I had this issue of lags and glitches, the game looses connection with the server at critical time- during a fierce team fight or the last zone or hear a nearby footsteps though not shown on the map. And when I get back, it's too late. Please, look into this. Thanks ! Cheers!",4
"The game is good, the graphics and gameplay is super-awesome, there is a variety of multiplayer modes, but I think there should be a kind-of STORY MODE, which is multiplayer in the form of a story which has different missions and there are rewards for each of the levels. And you guys should also make a sort-of creative mode, where we need to make our base and fight zombies. So that it can match games such as Fortnite, PUBG, Free Fire and others. But a good game overall, would love to play it!",5
"I really like this game. You have many options for how to play, you have many maps, and overall is really fun to play. I personally would like more classic weapons, like the marksman rifles. Edit: we have gotten these, and I love them. The satisfaction of a single shot headshot or cracking ope. Of a barrel makes this game twice as good when I'm on a bad day. I would strongly recommend this, even for people not as into tactical shooters, as you can still horse around and have fun.",5
"Exciting game, excellent player base. Even through some people need some deodorant, they still make for a new, fun, challenging experience. On the terms of that, free items are worth the effort, alongside payed purchases. Regardless of what season it's on the game comes to terms with it's mobile competition. I may sound overzealous but trust me, I've been here since Call of Duty: World at War as a kid. I cannot stress how awesome this game is.",5
"I love the game but when you spend money, the odds of getting the good weapon are very slim. They'll make you purchase everything else first. When you purchase the battle pass, you get good things in the beginning and even in the middle. But near the end, you don't get anything. They want you to purchase an additional pass. That's not fair... As the other review stated, matchmaking isn't exactly fair. It should really include skill level as well. Aside from that, it's fun and addicting!",4
"This game, in terms of high octane action, is awesome. Lots of wild firefights and close escapes by helicopter. However, it is riddled with bugs, especially BR, that make it very frustrating. A fun game overall if you're not super competitive. There's still so many one-off bugs that make it frustrating and difficult to play. And I don't really know how damage calculating works, but sometimes it doesnt... there seems to be an increase in real players lately in matches, though, which is nice.",3
"So I am editing my review. As of the season 10 update I give this one star. Hopefully I can change it back. However I play with a controller. And with this update they did for season 10 made the controller unusable. I can get them to connect, the issue is with the mapping. The buttons are where they should be. But the button pressed don't corelate to what they should. And of course you can't use a third party software to correct it, even temporarily. So until it's fixed, if they even care.",4
"Excellent game with good graphics. I have 3 dislikes and likes. Dislikes: Time delay from drawing your weapon to firing. Occasional game crashing once a week or every couple weeks. The cost of upgrades, seasonal players, etc. Likes: Great graphics and interesting unique maps. Solid gun varieties and accessories. Sound effects and Goliath theme songü§ò",4
"The bots.. They are annoying af and ruin the experience in my opinion. They should get rid of them after a certain level in MP level. They are completely unless to have on the team serving no purpose other than running in circles not aiming properly, or not shooting at all. Furthermore, I'm not sure if I'm the only one that experiences this, but; when shooting or right after eliminating someone, the on screen toggles randomly stop working? So you're frozen not able to move or shoot.",3
"Rank matches are bad, unfair, and random because when people lose and they're an mvp or top 3 its still +1 -49-60. Even if some players left, have the most kills, or it was an 4-5 they'll still give you the same deduction. Earning is really randomized from 20-60 but mostly +20 - +39 making it really frustrating. Getting a same skills match is rare and there can be a team full of skill or full of newbies which is also unfair. Remove the bots. Add back the old zombies and new zombies.",3
"The game is great and amazing I like battle royal so much and Im a huge fan of zombie but there is some issues like low end devices can not play a really fun game with low graphics,I was one of them. The new zombie mode is not so good as classic one Championships are now trash , when the game make only 64 teams can win the championship and cod points no one played it , some people played it but not for fun The themes are not good too , the old season's themes was wonderful I hope you read this",4
I have not words other than LOVE for COD mobile. This is the best game and my favorite from all of the games in play store.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ It would add more joy if new update comes with few additional changes like it is difficult to figure out the direction from where the enemy is hitting you... if the direction and position are bit more visible may be in the mini map it would be more fun.... But also I'm not talking about making it easyüòÅüòâ It would be no fun without some difficulty.,5
"i'm giving it 2 stars because there's a bug with the ""karambit-shipwreck""where you can't use the skin and animation it's just completely bugged, i tried everything to fix it and it doesn't work, also i've been having a loading screen bug i've already got past it by spamming the back navigation button and pressing cancel on the 'exit game' popup. please fix the karambit bug it's really pissing me off though, (me being a free to play player).",2
"Love it best game app ever, it seems others are having slight problems, my phone runs this game perfectly, Sony Xperia. As for paying to be better, I disagree, I have only ever purchased one battle pass, if you play enough that pays for itself over and over. If you want the special weapons, then you have the option to buy them, but that's a want, not a need. I have only used the weapons that have been awarded, I'm not great at playing but have managed to score 140 kills in a few games. Great.",5
"Great game but the last update has some serious glitches in BR Mode. Game either crashes, freezes or gets in loop that can't correct itself. Also it's way to expensive to try and get good weapons. Update items that can be purchased in store more often also. Same old tired items. Overall fun gameplay.",4
"Never usually get FPS mobile games due to them being very one dimensional, however COD mobile is probably the best one I've played so far as it has various modes to play with. On top of that it runs very smoothly and the graphics are good depending on what settings you play at. However, overall gameplay depend on the WiFi you have as it can effect the gameplay. UPDATE !!! 01/06/2022 Gameplay still good but constant downloading/updating for just new designs is not necessary.",4
"I really like it. The graphicsand audio are good. However, if you want to look good and you want legendary and mythical skins then you need to pay money. After a while though, honestly it gets too easy...üòé Ok after a few months after this review it is getting really boring üò¥. But now its getting better. Honestly there's like a flow. Over some periods of time , everyone's using smg then it changes and everyone's using ar's. This means you gotta adapt to the changes that happen. Overall good :)",5
"I have been playing since the release and I love it. Graphics are amazing even for phones that aren't as upgraded for gaming. Controls are extensive and easily understood, as well as setting. There's been bugs and cheaters of course, as with most good multiplayer games worth anything, it's a given. The options to win skins, guns, and etc are easily attainable if you put in the time. I wish they'd bring back the zombies that are more like console versions are, but they'll do. Recommended.",5
"Best fps experience you can get on mobile. The controls are simple, and don't cover the entire display. You can customise them as well. Graphics are great. Would be nice if we could get an update to run 90Hz with higher graphics settings since currently it caps it in medium. Would like it if Ranked playlist was more friendly to solo players. Bringing back 'solo player protection' would be good. Been playing this game for about 3 years now. I am glad to see it hasn't stopped getting better.",5
"My game crashes. Every second game. All the time. I have a pretty decent phone so it should handle the game just fine. I have tried clearing the cache. Emptying the storage. Changing the graphics to the lowest settings. My game just crashes. I uninstalled and intsalled 3GB of this game all over again, hoping it would help but whaddya know. It keeps crashes. Just shuts down. At the worst possible times. Rating 1 star till I get some sort of fix.",4
"A game worth playing, even in 2022 For a.mobile game that's been around for a couple years now, it's still got tons of players, great graphics, new updates, patches and seasons full of crazy cool stuff to unlock, even if you're the type of person who doesn't want to spend any money here. Customization and unlockables are through the roof. Freedom and room for experimentation is expansive. And gamemodes that are fun and interesting. All around, a great game!",5
"Up untill the recent updates, gaming experience was fun and balanced and was the best fps ever , but after the new release the opposing teams are flying all over the place at a speed which was not there at all and difficult to aim, i have a great phone and high speed fiber net, still not able to shoot at this supersonic opponents, Something is not correct. And to get in to the game , you need to go through a minimum of 4 screens, how frustrating it can be.",3
"Great game, honestly . Been playing for almost a year now. Just received a problem where I can't log in or load into my account. On the load screen before starting up the game it keeps saying 'timeout' before finishing the load, and also says 'update error'. So I can't start the game. My wifi is connected, nothing wrong with the network speed. Is there any way I could have assistance with this please?",5
Amazing game! I think the game storage optimization could be better. It takes up lots of storage! I also think it should have pve co-op and single player modes to switch things up a bit! I also think thr game menus could be cleaned up and visually improved. The menus look very clutterred with so many small buttons and it does not look very clean. I also think ground war should be permanent Other than that amazing game! Edit: I also think there should be a custom profile picture option,5
"It's cool game I ve been playing for almost 2 year. One of the most annoying things I found in this game are the ""bots"" especially at the very end of BR.... they're totally unnecessary...they can blow your cover and sometimes interfere during a fight between 2 teams which can creat a distraction and ruin the fun for everyone... I thing they need to be taken off at certain time of the round maybe somewhere during the mid or near the end",4
"Great game, i love it. I only have two issues with it 1) It keeps throwing me into matches that are already half way over so i don't have time to get MVP or a lot of kills which makes my ""history"" look bad 2) I can't select the map I want to go to. It's stuck on ""random"" and I still end up playing at ""crash"" 14 times in a row which is annoying",4
It's the best game ever according to me. You will not get this kind of graphics in any other mobile game and it has more than 30 to 40 modes in mp and br. You can also play it with friends ( including private matches) in which ever mode you want. It requires a little bit more space and wifi than other games.,5
The game was really good at one time until this last update after purchasing a premium pass it seems like after about 2 or 3 minutes the game keeps shutting down then you go back in and get penalized. Now after Re-downloading the game I can't even get past the credits I've been waiting for about 2 weeks for them to fix this I hope they do something about it I would like to start playing the game again before my pass runs out!!!!!,4
"This is an amazing game! It's kinda addicting, but, alright! I've gotten many likes and a few dislikes. Let's start on with the dislikes. Dislikes: In a match of gunfight, when we start the 1st round, the guns won't load. The screen lags bad at a new map. Likes: It's variety of guns. The realisticness. It trains you with eye contacts with enemy, for shooting with great aims. If you're bad at the game, you can just go for the practice sessions. The headshots, bloodthirsty & other comments",5
"With the last update the game is complete garbage, it's either I have supremacy over all the other opponents and they can't get a shot to hit me or I show up on the opponents screen like a retarded person shooting the other way or not seeing them comming, there's no use of sending feedback, reporting bugs or suggesting solutions. I had a very good time playing ground war though, but I'm not gonna thank you for that, you took it a way, I didn't pay a penny for this so I had fun on your pockets.",1
"Nearly perfect, the graphics are great, controls are great, the game is awesome! I absolutely love it. The only problem is the zombies. Please, just bring back the classic zombies and leave it there. That zombies is perfect and we just want that. It'd also be cool to have some of the classic zombies maps. The battle royale mode is great and the multiplayer mode is awesome, I'd also like if there were some BO3 Multiplayer maps like redwood and black ops 3 nuketown. Thanks for this great CoD game!",5
"Adjusting to one star because the new updates suck. It's never had much of a good ""skill based matchmaking"" but now? It's either complete apk lobbies or 15 games straight getting demolished as soon as you touch ground. Or constantly being placed solo in quads is really annoying. Being fully plated and using a gun completely maxed, there's no way I should die 3 shots in, right after I dump 30 in the enemy just because he paid for a skin. This game may be free, but it's definitely pay to win.",1
"The game is amazing, a very immersive competition mode allows for any mobile rank player to enjoy the time. One issue though is the amount of people who leave the game or disconnect in the later or higher ranks. It tends to get agitating and leads to a disadvantage. You still tend to lose points even if you did well. Other than that the game is very well developed. Meta takes over the game in serious manner though :/",5
"I liked this game very much it is a brilliant game. But, when I started this game, I did not have storage so I did not downloaded the HD resource pack but later on when I downloaded it, it said restart or enter a match to see improved graphics I tried them both but the graphics were same. Please fix the issue because graphics in a good game matter a lot. And it uses a lot of Internet so I had to delete it.",4
"All i have to say is please bring back the old graphics settings. Since the update my gaming experience is ruined because of the new graphics preference. I downloaded all the resources for nothing because it didnt change anything. This update has been full of bugs and glitches the audio in br is messed up. I cant hear vehicles going nearby. Most of the enemies are invisible or appear after a while. If you dont fix this issue soon, people will stop playing this game. Its getting annoying",3
"This is an amazing game. Good graphics, easy controls, multitudes of weapons and tech for those weapons and amazing maps including Nuketown. there are campers but that's a given in any FPS game. If you get the right weapon and are skilled enough you'll be able to dominate the battlefield. The only problem is the option to connect a controller because it makes it a little unfair as a controller gives more control over shooting/ moving.",5
"This game is wonderfully made and beautifully designed. The thought that went into the map layouts is nothing short of genius. It really gives one the freedom to get creative during evasive and assault movements, and it has that cod gameplay that others come close to replicating but fall short. As for crashing lagging and all that, i have no problems whatsoever. Then again i have a decent phone with stable internet. Wanted it for years thank you for it lots!",5
"The new season 5(2022) really made me disappointed. The amount of bugs is absurd. The main problem for me is that when I open the game, after the login screen it's stuck on the loading screen for 30 seconds - 1 minute and then it says loading timeout. I can't login into my account and i can't play the damn game. If this problem were to be fixed I would probably give a 3-4 star review",1
The game's awesome and I'm definitely a call of duty fan. This is the best game ever would highly recommend it. You even get free stuff very often through events. Also could you please fix the constant lags that are occurring during the recent seasons. Also please optimize the battle royale as it is very choppy and during matches there are random ping spikes so please fix all of the above issues.,5
"Great killer game with top of the line graphics & different options & game modes. Not too realistic of images, but neither too poor of an image that makes it look cheap like all these other shooting games tend to do. Some of them have no business & makes me wonder how the hell did they manage to put this garbage out on the market. Waste of time & space messing with these other games. So stop wasting your time & get on it & download it today, I promise you'll love Call of Duty. I guarantee it! Jr",5
"The best shooter game available on mobile no lag, bugs or glicthes at all. Absolutely astonishing graphics. There is no advantage for players with controllers, players on mobile can just use 4 finger claw layout and players on tablets can even use 6 finger layout. It has simple controls which contribute to some of the most complex techniques. Simply the best fps in the market and my favourite mobile game.",5
"Okay so the game is awesome. The graphics are awesome, even for some of the low end devices. The fps work well. The weapons are constantly being balanced (every season there are some balance changes) so no weapon can be too powerful for long. While the huge updates every month could be a hassle, there is always new content and a weapon added each season so the game never feels outdated. Simply one of the best games out there.",5
"the game's quite nice, offering different game modes including battle royale, so you don't have to download something separately and stuff... however, can we have it more serious with less weapon and backpack camos? i mean, it's all right to have a blood-stained melee or a gun with a kinda nose-art, but those awfully designed camos are actually awful, since they exist and take noticeable part of memory altogether, which is rather an evil addition to unskippable loading screens at every start.",3
Love this game been playing this all my life but when your playing ranked and the hole server freezes and you have to leave cause when they un freeze your stuck spectating the person who killed you to top that off you get points taken away and a five minute band on ranked matches. its not too bad but rather annoying. still its top quality and provides a stellar amount of entertainment 5 stars.,5
"I love this game. Have been playing it for over two years now and will keep continuing to play because I am crazy loyal to this brand. However, the last two updates have made the game really slow. Even right now I've been trying to play for the last couple of days and it's giving me one error or another. Currently, the game isn't even opening for all sorts of reasons. If these small issues are fixed, then this is a perfect game",4
I have been playing this game from a long time. The controls and graphics are too good. But the main issue here is the storage of the game. When we download from the play store the game is around 2GB but as we start there are multiple downloads and the size of the game just goes from 2gb to 15gb. Pls try to compress the game little so that the people could play the game lag free. And there is another issue as the game crashes sometimes and it's frustrating.,5
"Great game, but the random draws for items being progresively more expensive on each draw is absurd. The draws get so expensive i could buy a full price console game by the time i get the skin or weapon want. Id rather just buy the item separately or have the random draws at a consistent price. Love everything about the game except the gamble mechanic.",5
I find this game fun to play with friends. When. They added the gunsmith that game became more competitive except for a few guns such as the kar98 and the dhr being really good. The maps load good and ranked is a lot of fun when playing with friends. However the game take up and insane amount of space and finding a lobby can take a bit or just not work at time. Also there is constant redownloading resources data before you can play and that can take up to 45 min. On good internet.,4
Overall a very great game. I've been playing since it came out and I absolutely love it. I would 100% recommend this game to people and I have to my friends and they all got addicted as well. Only two negatives: Some advice to the creators - the old zombies need to come back because the new isn't great. BR was better with adrenalines not super armour.,5
This game is solid it has a ton of weapons that keep growing and tons of people. It has clean controls and they're customizable. Graphics and maps are great so is realistic scopes. You don't have to buy anything to be good at the game it's a skill base and not a pay-to-win game.,4
"From a 4.5 to a 1 back to 3. I have a love hate relationship with this game. It's a fun... ""CASUAL"" game per say, however the decisions behind how public and ranked matches are matchmade with human and bots confuses me. The game seems optimized only for high to low end phones released during the time the game was released, as older and newer phones seem to have optimization issues. My A20 barely runs the game, but as someone who's played since release, I will continue to play until I cannot.",3
"Fun Real experience,, Awesome audios Cool guns and skins. Though some things need to be improved like - Heavy Network and storage needed. Also the best thing is that it has more than 20 modes in MP for eg. Hardpoint ,, S&D ,, 1V1 DUEL ,, SNIPERS ONLY ,, DROP Zone etc. and over 10 modes in BR also 25-30 innovative maps in MP and 2 Innovative maps in BR which makes it pretty creative. Overall I give it a 5 üåü...... Thank you!!!",5
"Fun game, fair matchmaking, not pay to win! Graphics and gameplay are awesome. Lots of action! The balance between guns is good and its fun to see that not all people like the same weapon. Only negative point: This game is huge! Takes a lot of space on device. I always have some space issues at every update. The game starts to be clogged with too much stuff (too many characters, weapons, classes, operator skills) which makes downloading long and problematic when they update.",4
"Simply great cod experience on the go, and the way there's so much CoD Gold (maps, weapons) makes it even better for the fans. EDIT: I have a huge issue with hackers once you get to pro ranked though, some are just sweats but others are obviously hacking and there seems to be some pay to win involving guns, also servers cause you do die one shot, yet in reality on killcam they were shooting at you a good bit, that's pretty much unplayable for ranked matches",3
"Full of bugs, poor optimization, random freezes, fps drops, sounds glitching off all the time, constant messing around with sensitivities and hip firing settings every other patch, movement has been made so stiff (battle royale). I feel I may delete the game at any momment as they only seem to care about pushing new skins and cosmetics but not fixing those bugs that cause a poor gaming experience. Edit: A lot of the previous issues have been fixed but it still needs a lot of optimization (BR)",3
"Absolutely love the game, I've been playing for maybe over two years,I don't buy anything so has taken a while to build up my skills, I know I can never be as good as the top players but I think I am concidering I don't spend money, one thing though I've got two players one through FB and one as a guest but you can't pick which one you want to play it always starts from the last one unless you're game crashes then you can choose, would like to choose when the game starts",4
"It's a pretty fun game. I was top 3 in the country for almost a week. Customizable control layouts, weapons, ect. But the updates are always so big and often. They need to space the updates to where you don't have to burn up your data each time you open the game.",3
"The game is amazing, the only issue is the draws and crates. It ends up being so expensive just to get an item you want. Maybe make it cheaper? Or maybe lower the price per draw? Because its insane to have to spent 4,700 for the last draw. Same goes for crates since its based on luck. Thats insane. The cp prices are fine but the draws and crates need to be fixed. The coupons are really nice for f2p. Overall, the game is great and i have been enjoying it. Keep up the good work devs",5
"Mechanics are great. Feels like a true COD. I've been playing for months, but I've noticed some updates breaking a gigabyte, on top of the initial 10gb download (approximately). Just curious if these updates merge with the game or if my Call of Duty app will soon be 25gb. Either way, the constant addition of content is awesome.",4
"Adding to the below; Everything costs to gain, the game has become so expensive and lacks in new fields of play and more true game play. The fact a person can kill an opponent with one shot from a knife or boxing gloves but takes several shots with guns is absurd! Separate these or make it more realistic! Why are the Mythic guns so far and few. Outfits , helmets and gear are virtually unavailable, offers to purchase gear to create your own look should be offered!",4
It's the best game ever according to me. You will not get this kind of graphics in any other mobile game and it has more than 30 to 40 modes in mp and br. You can also play it with friends (including private matches) in which ever mode you want. It requires a little bit more space and wifi than other games.,5
This game was great in the early stages and now it seems it's all about the next content. I've spent more time recently just collecting the new skins and less time actually playing simply because of the enormous amount of additional armory ads that try to make you purchase cod coins the actual game playability has dropped right off and matches seem to be very glitchy the only thing that works well is the payment system that always let's you purchase.,3
"Best fps experience you can get on mobile. The controls are simple, and don't cover the entire display. You can customise them as well. Graphics are great. Would be nice if we could get an update to run 90Hz with higher graphics settings since currently it caps it in medium. Would like it if Ranked playlist was more friendly to solo players. Bringing back 'solo player protection' would be good. Been playing this game for about 3 years now. I am glad to see it hasn't stopped getting better.",5
"A brilliant game with all the excitement as on XBox, I love it. No Ads, easy log in & start a match with no problems. New Season every month with an amazing music score which I always love. Whoever makes that music, totally original score btw, is amazing. Please keep posting the music Behind the Scenes on YT:) The game works perfect, with only some lag after playing for ages, overall smooth gameplay. A great community to be apart of. Every player I've met is friendly too, amazing in this day&age",5
"Literally best game ever. Great graphics, gameplay is on point, so much to choose from. Keeps you on your toes with different missions and targets to look forward to, while being rewarded for good play. I play nothing else now. The only thing I dislike is the campers who ruin the game üòÇ",5
"From 2 stars to 4 , issues of crashing have stopped! Now, I just have to worry about not being good enough to compete ! Great game but the crashing and re-booting in game play on Android are almost 2+ months old now, still no fix and getting old. If you like playing a game and having it crash during every game, this is now the game for you. The randomness of will it crash when in a safe spot or will it crash when you are about to be shot, should be a world wide drinking game here soon.",4
"Hello, I would love to see a 3rd person Team Death Match . No Classes , infinite plates. That would be great for warm ups and sharpening skills. I don't like that the game doesn't have a BR training area. This would be great for Battle Royal beginners. I know MP mode has a practice mode in 1st person but Its not the same. Also It would be great if players could save multiple button layouts. Sometimes you want to try something new without tampering with your current setup.",4
"I love this game, but cmon i have to upgrade and or update something every time. Its soo annoying for the fact that i have no choice if i wana play the game again. I have no problem with your Creativity and graphics updates. I just wish downloading it was optional. This wild dogs version has pushed me to deleting the game altogether. My phone cant handle it. Food for thought.",2
It's a nice game with great graphics and all stuff I do really love it... I been playing Call of duty for more than a year had recently I changed my device so I could play more but now am not able to play that each time I log in it's show timeout... I don't know why it show... For one two times it's ok but more than a 10 it's a prob... So please try to check on this issue... But than that I really love this game and it's great...üëçüèª,2
I can't stop playing üòÅüòÅüòÜüòÜüòÖ it's amazing what Activision has in the gaming industry especially with the new update. KUDOS. Personally I agree with alot of people on the memory and connection subject but ultimately I've realized that I don't really mind honestly because I hardly use my phone for anything else but I make sure to transfer everything I don't need on my phone to an external hard drive apart from that I give this game a 6üåü only on flagship devices of course.,5
"Really nice game, billion of wepon combos and super real graphics. Just the one problem, the space it takes. I don't know why but I am not able to download the new season 5, maybe it's because the space or mabe it's just some glitch. But overall it's a OP game and it's definitely worth a try. It has so many game modes every weekend there is a 10v10 Game mode and the Battle royale is justy favvvv.",4
The controls are good . Sensitivity is just superb it lags sometimes but it is fine. I shifted from free fire to cod and there was a significant difference between botht he games . Graphics are just too good even at low. You can customise your settings according to your comfort . It is just marvelous game. I just want a favour that pls try and make the matchmaking a bit balanced and do not allow people to leave ranked matches. People come and leave which can be frustrating some times.,5
I made a review for this game in December of 2020 you can check the edit history. They fixed the moving bug I was talking about but I don't think they lowered the price for the CP. I am just saying that it's improved since 2020 but the most gigantic problem on here is the storage it takes up on my phone it is currently taking up 12 GB like that's crazy and I haven't even downloaded everything if I downloaded the rest it would prob be like 15 GB. That's why it's 4 stars for me. But I've joined,4
This game is really fun interactive and real playing experience!! The auto shoot is particularly good considering it is a mobile game. the only thing I would improve is at the very start it feels very tacky going through each stage of setting up and remind me of the many other mobile shooting games which end up being really bad. Downgrading to 4 star's as it is very frustrating having to download big files almost every time I log onto the app!,4
"While it can be very fun at times, it's plagued with game-breaking bugs. Sometimes in the middle of a match, my phone will lock without turning the screen off. That disables all my inputs and requires me to toggle the screen on and off. There's also many issues with controller compatibility, framerate and so much more. Heck, it forced me to join a ranked match when I didn't even know if my controls were working or not.",3
"This game for me has changed mobile gaming. I play with my friends everyday, the draws, crates, BP, etc are all decent if not better. Graphics are good, adjustable settings and controls are great. I don't lag or overheat too often. If you did change something maybe put in more unlockable skins and camps for certain weapons such as the M16, KN-44, etc. Also maybe look into some things from other guns like the Ballista sniper rifle from Call Of Duty 2: Black ops. Overall 5 stars, keep it up devs.",5
"There are some probelms. You lose 80 xp in ranked when you loose internet connection. This is annoying and must be fixed. Many times my ping will rise and will cause my bullets to not register. Including desync, lag, and delay in timing. Defuse and plant buttons cancel randomly. Overall a good app, but if your ms is reaching 100 to 199, then your in for lots of annoying problems.",4
"Awesome game play and graphics and gameplay is free, it's goes a long way. Only the cost for extras inturns rips off customers. Your drop rates and cost for extras is not worth and is a big take away to enjoy gameplay. I doubt the moblie net worth is 1.32 Million dollars. With the drop rates and cost between each choice the prices can go up to $100 for just one item. That's more then a actual game use to be. Stop ripping off loyal gamers and be legitimate about your pricing. Thank you.",3
"The experience, grafics, guns, skins and popularity with the amazing original cod maps make this game so much fun. If you would like want to get some cool skins I would rather you buy the cod points that are in the 9.99 plus tax. Because I wouldn't want you wasting your money on the spins because it's not worth it. It's better if you get the 9.99 plus tax because it gives you enough cod points to get the premium version of the battle pass than the original battle pass because it gives you extr",5
This game's overall the best i have been playing the mobile version which is this one for years And it never disappoints me it's super fun and addicting but lately i faced a problem where i cannot get into the game and everytime I try it shows me a screen with this message:sorry there was an error during the Google play download pls make sure youre connected to a stable network and try again later... Ive tried later on and my wifi is perfectly fine and yet it still shows up :( it was fine before,5
"Best mobile FPS game I have played, however the fact that updates are huge is concerning especially for a mobile game. Not to mention having to re-download gun skins, player models, and maps on top of that, it adds up to be a lot especially if you need to use cell data like I currently do. Also the fact you practically have to gamble to try to get something if you really wanted it could add up $$ if you weren't careful. Stick to just the season pass stuff, don't bother doing the draw stuff.",3
"Awesome graphics and very high competition from all around the world. Way better than PUBG ü§≠. Hey CODM I would like to request for us phone users, if you could enable an option where you can delete non essential files for example, I've been updating my game ever since I downloaded and now it's consumed over 15GB space. It would be awesome if the game after installing updates it can delete the files so that not much space is used up, thank you",5
"I have been playing for over 2 years and I love it. An absolute blast. High quality graphics, fun games and challenges that they are always changing up, meet new friends to play with, and they have made so many changes to improve overall game play and game quality. There were so many issues 2 years ago but now there are hardly any. Would highly recommend to anyone. The only downside is the game takes up a ton of space.",5
"Best on an 8"" tablet in my opinion. The intensity of the action has helped my nerves and will hone your perception skills. You know how a mouse moves if you try and catch it and your nerves start to jump?? I think I can grab a mouse now. Also take advantage of Google play points when adding to your team, work for bonuses and freebies. I'm happy with my swat team and arsenal.",5
"This has to be the best game I have ever played. It's getting to the point where I play it every day. I love the graphics, gameplay, and almost all the weapons (Pharo hater). I thought wish that the good old zombie mode comes back. Also, even tho there is a thermal scope on the arctic 50 in battle royale, I wish there was a thermal in multiplayer. But this is still one of the greatest games.",5
"I'm going to start with it's an amazing fun game to play, although there are some bugs and glitches that need to be fixed. Ping seems to be a continuous issue that a lot of people have, maybe there a way to fix this developer? One thing I don't like is that to purchase a whole lucky draw, it costs about 120-130$ USD. That's crazy to me at least because you can buy full on games on console for half the price. It's very expensive, and for what it's worth I don't think it's a very reasonable price.",4
"Have been playing the game since 2 years and lately it has become unplayable. Ranked in particular has become so laggy its annoying the hell out of everybody. The developers should focus on fixing the basics like lag issues rather than adding maps, modes, seasons etc and making the game more heavy and resource intensive with each season. Very Dissapointed",2
"I bet it's a great game lol, if I could actually get past the loading screen. Literally crashes on the loading screen. Every. Time. If i could rate it lower I would. I've been trying for HOURS to get it to work. Do better. -update I got it to work and now I'm just trying to get my controller to work, sometimes it does and other times it doesn't register only on this app. üôÉ",3
"I've been looking for a kind of console lvl fps for along time and I finally found it! The time is 3AM and I just stopped playing haha...great game!! I really would give five stars but there's a small issue that is beginning to annoy me, the game keeps stopping for some magical reason lol...and luckily not mid game but like when I'm changing my loadout or character in which I am forced to keep restarting the game. Please fix.",4
It is a very good game. It does need some work. Like to add more items or guns. It's fun if you like the call of duty games that are on PC and game consoles. I always thought this was a black ops. But I don't know for sure it may be part of the modern warfare series. So that will be cool if they told us if it's a black ops or modern warfare of if it is in any at all.,5
"Literally the best mobile shooter game yet... I absolutely love the graphics, i have a beefy phone and play ultra settings, with 40 fps! The only thing is, it takes up 12 gb of my storage in total, but that is fine, as i have 100gb. Anyway, love the customization, different modes, and how you can play with your friends... best of all, its FREE! Love you all, activision. Keep up the amazing work!!! I think you could add building options!",5
"There are glitches from time to time and they are fixed or updated. Normal game play I suppose. But when you aim your gun directly at an opponent and nothing happens, except their gun shooting you that's bad juju on whoever is in charge. Oh and why not give a better option than just a pistol when coming back down from the revival flight. Kinda hard to land in a war zone with just a pea shooter.",4
"I'm glad you hear what we want for the most part, but the snowboards are too slow, I understand starting out with only one grappling hook but when you upgrade it should go back to three. And for battle royale it would be cool if towards the end of the match it turned to night time to add some suspense. Finally zombies is awful you should have a few nights to gather supplies at a base until a nuke wipes them or something the teleporter doesn't make any sense and it's frankly super boring.",4
"This is probably one of the best mobile games right now. Excellent gameplay and graphics comparable to the console versions of the game and is not pay2win unlike many other mobile games around at the moment. The only couple of cons I can think of is that the game pairs you mostly with bots when you first start playing and in my opinion the menus could be a little more simple, but overall I am very impressed. 5/5",5
"It is a very good game overall, i think my favorite one on mobile platform. I mostly play it for the multilayer mode not the battle royal. It can be challenging when you play ranked, but it's not frustrating, you can always switch up to a more relaxed public match. Here are few things which could really help the player base to grow: always available alcatraz map, the first generation of the zombie mode, some kind of prestiege system with posible cp rewards. Otherwise it is a contentfull game.",5
"Love hate relationship. Great game and i love the tough matches win or lose. But its the matches where I get killed every 5 seconds even when I've hit the other player first, the players literally come through walls, move super fast hat make this so frustrating. It's off-putting. Same for the super easy games where I barely make an effort and I'm still mvp.",4
When it says small app it lies after you install the app there are so much more to download if you want full effects and to be able to play with your friends. If you don't have good internet then also forget about it. I enjoy the game it's fun and interactive. Just it's so big some people can not update the newest features and are left in the past.,4
"Please help me out whenever I try to play the game an issue pops up ""please prohibit from using third party plug ins"" ive tried to solve the issue through youtube tutorials but nothing has helped me so far and when i try to click the help button nothing comes up which might be a lag. other than this the game is pretty good. would give it 5 stars if they had instructions on how to fix this issue.",3
"I play alot and the only problem is that the killcam is very inaccurate most times. And it doesn't always show. It's also nice that we have new maps every now and then for multiplayer but, It would be interesting to have a bot survival mode where hordes of bots with a difficulty that keeps rising every round to come at a squad of 4 players. Since the best zombies game mode didn't last and we're left with the not so interesting zombies mode we have now. However here's 5 üåü for MP & BR game modes.",5
"I love this game. It's my favorite fps game I've found for mobile but my biggest issue is with the down loading. You have sooooo much days to download for characters, weapons, skins, pretty much everything. It's so much, to download everything is crazy data. But then every time a new season drops and you have to update, you have to redownload everything. That's what drove me away before. If like to say I'll stock around this time but with more and more other games coming up, I can't promise.",4
"The game is great. There isn't a problem in any way for me there in that department. As far as I'm concerned the game fills in the spots needed for many player types and always has something new to add in to the games fun that keep me playing. However I am stuck at the moment with a 100% download for the last update. 1.53Gb . It won't start the game now and sends me to a screen saying I have the whole new file. I love my character and wish to continue playing Please Help. Concerned Player,",4
"It's good, you can't ask for more on a mobile device, it lags when two high ranking players encounter eachother in BR mode, but only slightly, maybe the mechanics maybe its rigged but it only happens when there's between 50 and 100 players in the game. At the end when theres only the top ten it runs pretty smooth. It makes sense enough. I haven't paid for anything at All, and it still gives me a lot of entertainment, I still wipe the map with players that get all the special weapons and pay for",4
I've been playing this game for over 2 years. I'm at the maximum level never have I bought anything on the game....However they do allow anyone with a bought outfit or bought gun to somehow be invincible no matter how many times they are shot lol. Overall it is a great game but just that one little thing can be frustrating when you are competitive like meüòÜ,5
It's a good game but it's very pay to play which I can understand but the one time I decided to use that feature what I used it on I wasn't able to get what I wanted and wish it could be able to be worked for instead of paid for. I just think it would be beneficial to able to do it both ways because it's unfair to those who can't afford it even if said item was difficult to achieve. Thank you,2
"I had nothing but great things to say previously, but I unlocked Nikto from the lucky draw, and ever since the gunfire, footsteps, A.I. voice overs and everything is silent half of the time. It's very aggravating, to say the least, and has caused losses which otherwise could've been prevented. Sound is crucial in this game, so please fix this issue, along with the doors of buildings disappearing occasionally in BR.",4
"Used to be Great! It's not anymore though. I used to play this game a lot, and evem unlocked many things like the damascus camo, and I would like to play the game casually every once and a while. However, I have to download several hours worth of updates every month, and by then, I've lost interest. Also, the is completely marketed towards children now, which is a negative. I hope this game one day returns to a better state, but I know that will never happen.",1
"Been playing for about 6 months now and have enjoyed every moment of playing this game, been playing CoD since the first so I always love to give them a try. CoD:M is definitely worth the space if you are hard-core about games like this controls are easy to use and graphics are phenomenal. Always unlocking new things through easy daily tasks or a little daily grind on certain game modes but all of it attainable keep up the great work!!",5
"The game itself is great, but to take up 18 gb's of someone's mobile device just too much. Although it is glitchy, it is fun and a great game to play but it's hard to sacrifice storage space, most phones just simply don't have it. Although I love it and have played a long ways, I got to delete it simply for the storage, are there things run like s*** because there's no space left .",3
"Great execution for mobile game. I hook my phone up to my ps4 remote and up to my TV, and the feel of the game is like playing on a console. The reason for my 3 stars is that the game is only partially remote control compatible, the lobby is not able to controlled on the remote. When using the TouchPad I see the cursor but when I click there is no action. Meaning I have to get up from the couch and tap my way start the game and after match ends. If you fix this, it's a 5 star game for me.",3
"Dear Activision CoD mobile team The game is perfect. But ever since the update came wich reduced the game's size has also came with a bug, once after you download the hd resources in game it says to restart but my game was still like hd resource Pack was not applied, same case with audio pack. I tried all ways uninstalling the game, clearing cache etc. Please kindly fix the bug as soon as possible.",3
"BR blackout-warfare is now way better than it used to be no frame drops, no freezing, and no me dying without even knowing because the game froze. The game still drops frames from time to time but not as much as it used to. But aside from that mostly everything is great, best one being Attack of the Undead 20",5
"I don't know what is going on at the moment but there are characters in the br I have never seen before and all of the games (br, ranked, mp) are impossible to win. Hardcore players with things I've never seen totally dominate games. I've been level 150 for over 1 year and win 95% of matches I play but now I get killed quickly. Either there is a heap of players with a cheat on or I am being put into matches with the world's best players. I'm over it and probably won't play any more!",1
"Not pay to play. Not pay to win. However, the gameplay gets worse with each update. Graphics are nice, but the overall gameplay has taken a turn for the worse. Game gets sluggish with each update. Getting to the point I'm going to just drop the game all together. Fiber, 5g, etc... all sluggish and lagging. Galaxy n20+. It's not me, it's you.",1
"I am playing Call of Duty: Mobile last 2 years and it was a great experience. But from the last 2 season I am facing problem of ""download configuration failed check your internet connection"" Whenever I open a game. But my internet connection is excellent. I am really tired by seeing this please do something about this Call of duty mobile is my favorite game i don't want quit this.",1
"The game is incredibly addictive, but it is a serious money suck. You can play for free, but if you don't buy COD points for a season you don't get any good stuff. They are constantly releasing ""lucky draws"" where you spend more COD points to take a chance at something cool. Problem is, the best stuff has less than a .05% chance of dropping so you end up having to buy more points. If you don't have any to start, it can cost over $100 just to win that one item you want.",3
"After playing a while I've seen some issues. While gun balance is still fairly decent, and it isn't blatantly pay to win like it used to be, certain gun skins locked behind pay walls offer far better iron sights than others. Another major issue is the removal of bot pool lobbies. Those really made sure that I could have fun, even if I was having a bad day and wasn't doing well in populated lobbies. Please bring them back.",5
"Love the game, but after the most recent update, the loading screen is forever. Before it would take maybe 30 sec to load up the game. Now it takes a few minutes, almost feels like the game is hung, then you see the 99% after like a minute... To me why fix something that wasnt broken.",5
"The Best game I've ever played. BR is at it's best, driving controls are superb and the most i like is aiming. I use a 3gb RAM tab but it runs smooth the only problem is the graphics. I'm not saying the graphics are worse but, the graphics are not good for low end devices eventhough, still the graphics are better than the shooting games out there..... Best game and i recommend everyone to download itüôåüèº",5
"The game is pretty impressive, considering the amount of content, but I'm so disappointed in the Lucky Draw system. It costs over $100 to actually get the star items through draws, and to be clear, legendary items are exclusively available through specific draws. Full bundles are available on console for around $20, they're simply broken down and marked up on mobile. I've spent a hundreds on CoD games in the last year alone, courts are addressing the ""draw"" mechanic, just let us buy the bundle.",2
"This is definitely the best fps game I've ever seen on playstore that has the best graphics, and has almost all categories of game play, shooting, warfare, driving, swimming, battle royale, multiplayer, PVP and there are so many cool characters, themes are awesome and overall, it's become my favourite mobile game, I haven't found any problems with this game",5
"One of the best to put your skills against others... With your friends!... Good way to kill some time! The graphics are great, operater skills add up the spice and make things more interesting. One issue is the huge size of the game. The game overall is great",5
"The FPS is so much better than most battle royale. It's just the scope in animation is too slow, and there are lots of animations not needed actually. The unattached scopes spread on the field is useless. Please improve the Ads and hip fire movement. Also please try to improve the useless animations.",4
"I'm playing this game from more than a year. But This recent update of season 5 is very disappointing .It is full of glitches and most importantly , I'm facing a major problem, I'm not able to enter the game .It keeps on loading n loading.This was not Expeced!! I request the developers to resolve this issue as soon as possible.",1
"It is a good game but currently I am facing issues related to starting the game. Every time I start the game it always shows download configuration failed. I have already tried every single thing to patch network on my device like patching DNS, force stopping and then giving reaccess to all networks, restarting my device and also tried the APN trick. Nothing seems to work. I have also redownloaded the game. I also changed networks and tried on wifi too. Everything I tried results into same prob.",2
The game is good the only thing that needs to be fixed is the perk persistence because it basically got a buff this season with the new point system. But they should need it so it's useless or just get rid of it because it ruins the game because you work so hard for your scorestreaks while some other noob dies 20 times and still gets the swarm and other broken streaks.,5
Graphics issues inside buildings. Disappearing Doors an windows. Lag spikes everytime the battle royal announcer opens it's mouth. Freezes in-game ranked matches. More lag spikes when players click the (Get my dog tags) button. When my device lags or freezes I tap it hard...This sets off screen rotate mode setting me upside down and have to reset the game to fix it.. As you can see the last patch has many bugs and some are BS for ranked matches,1
"It's an amazing game but I have a issue that in TDM previously it was the pattern of points but now there is rating system which is not good, I've seen many players are unsatisfied with that. so if you guys can fix it then it will good. Thanks",5
Keep popping up network error while I have very stable network and doesn't let me log in. I uninstalled and installed again and downloaded all the files again and Played for a bit. But after closing the app it won't let me log in. Other apps are working very fine and there is no network problem. Very disappointed.,1
"Ever since the update for season 4 ( wild dogs). I have been unable to enjoy a game. For the interests of the player and developer, I suggest you reverse whatever "" upgrade "" was done. Don't forget that when you continually buff up the storage size of games and run time, the phones remain the same. I must not necessarily have a high end thousand dollar devices to play your game.",2
"Loving the game. Although I'm facing some internet-related issues(connected to a decent internet) on Battle Royale. Also, still talking about Battle Royale (only), the matchmaking process is unfair. I don't remember a single time, since reaching master, that I've faced equal oponents, which also makes it feel like there is no chance for improvement, as I'm always dying to gunskill, no matter how hard i try.",4
Google Pixel 6 Pro. 06/02/22. Game gets stuck on loading screen. Uninstalled and installed again (the whole game) downloaded the extra files (a lot of gigs for a mobile game) and it still does gets stuck on the loading screen. The music plays in the background but after closing the game the music is still playing,1
Game has been crashing so much for the past two seasons. I've never had this issue before. I would be in the main menu trying to download the resources and it would crash. I would be in the pre-match lobby and it will crash. I would be on a good kill streak and it will crash. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice already and restarted my phone countless times. The past two major updates have been extremely unstable. Please fix this.,2
Too much problem with the new season. Where previous seasons took seconds to load and there were almost no glitches but this new season takes a lot of time to load and the game has so many glitches thay i literally had to stop playing! Where every game in the world is getting better and better with latest updates and here is cod that's getting worse with every update. What a shame!,1
"A very good game! It's the best FPS to play while on the go. I really love codm.. but I do have 2 problems.. 1, the ms spikes, I usually have 50 to 70ms.. but just randomly when there are a lot of stuff on the screen my ms spikes up to 190ms and it stays like that for the rest of the match, 2nd thing is the price for draws, like if I have 1,000cp and I wanna spend it on a lucky draw, I would only get 3 spins, I'm not gonna keep spending cp for a skin that would cost 5$ and spin and make it 50$",4
Every BR match I get kicked out and penalized. Every other MP match it does the same thing. I enjoy it so much I deal with this frustration of connection. Fix this asap. Too many point been lost and I can't get them back especially if I'm not leaving a match purposefully but the system crashes and I'm penalized.,2
Originally gave a 5 star review but its impossible to play since the last update because of the glitching. Trying to do to much when it was fine to start with. I love the game when you can actually play it! All glitches have been fixed! Great game many different modes and ways to play.,5
"This is actually one of the best games nowadays. I really appreciate the developers. But there is one big problem bothering me, that when there are 3 or more enemy players around, I got so much lag and delay in the game. So that I lose concentration and easily get damage. Although I am a pro player, the enemies sometimes can easily kill me. And this is not fair. Please help me to solve this problem.",4
The game keeps crashing. I have to restart it like 5 or more times before I can actually play and even then when I play ranking matches it's really keeps crashing. I really want to say ever since the resent update. I'm about to delete it.,2
"For a phone game I can't complain too much. This is the best CoD I've played content wise, my only gripes are, why have different maps for different modes in multiplayer? Some times I forget about other maps Until I play a certain modes because rank or I get bored of the main ones I play. Breaking up content this way will not help you. I have never met one person who thinks that that was a good idea. Price is high, Gamplay fun, content plentiful, Loads of Bots, but in all fun. Bravo ACTIVISON",4
Nothing like call of duty. The game has stupid plastic/glossy animations everywhere and high contrast in all the visuals. Not even close to actual call of duty visuals. Looks like a classic Chinese knock off. Matchmaking for ranked matches is absolutely trash. Nothing's changed about this cash grab cow yet except for ridiculously large assets that take up to 12gb of storage space.,1
With more downloads. now more than ever we need a South African server. it is impossible to compete in the Grand Master and legendary classes with the ping.. it becoming more horrific and frustrating... please please consider the recommendation.. love the game non better out there. Just need to experience the game the way it was intended.,2
(Update) the throwables still have a delay on throws meaning you need to stay out of cover to ensure you don't suicide. Server instability has increased and people are lagging more often (quite rare though). MMR is complete dog poo and the quality of players is low. More points to be given on individual play rather than team play as campers/weak players get carried most the time. Turn melee into a 2 hit kill so snipers don't feel confident close range. Melee should be to finish wounded targets.,2
Guys the new update is awesome. So much improved graphics and so many new guns. I'll really enjoy using the new Oden. It's awesome. The game is awesome. Enjoyed playing Brother why do you give so much maps to download in every update. Can't the map be given by default when new update comes. Every new update is of 1.4 - 2 GB. Nd after update we see that all maps still needs to be downloaded. Map needs to be downloaded seperately of the game update that comes. Isn't there any workaround for this,5
"What's wrong with you?! After the latest update, irrespective of how good or bad the net connection is, it keeps saying ""time out"". Not being able to play since last week!! Still facing the same issue! Why aren't you fixing it?!! Okay.... I guess need to find another alternative then! (Edit: still no response after 3 months and facing the same problem!! Like they don't care at all!)",1
"You had this review coming, should have been last season but I hoped this S5 would be better, turns out it's worse. Lag is the worst this season since I started playing CoD over a year ago, opponents in BR render from nowhere, there's the sound seizing when I most need it, inability to see downloaded skins in both BR and MP, then this new bug with the mic and speaker buttons showing ""all"" twice and off, no ""friend"" or ""team"". It's so bad, please fix!",2
This game is becoming a joke. Every update ads a game ruining weapon. Weather its the molotov/thermite which is insta kill or some very cod like portal gun that sucks people into it. The ranked mode is pointless. You can be mvp twice in a row but if you loose one game (because its easy as hell to spawn trap) then you loose more xp then you could possibly win. It's becoming pay to win. Especially in battle royal. It was the best part of this game but I haven't touched it in weeks. Fix ya game.,3
"Tried to download the game again and once everything is set up and downloaded then you have to download the maps etc. Well when I try to do that, the whole app keeps closing and I can't even play a match or anything because the maps won't download due to the app closing it's self every single time I try to download the maps for the game. I went from being excited to play to just struggling to even keep the app opened. Thanks but no thanks...this is annoying.",1
I've been playing this game for a long time its actually really easy to win and I really love the game. But they should put that I match with people with the same skill level. Edit: the developers definitely put matches with the same skill level as me after 2 years of reinstalling.,5
"Very optimized at beginning of the season, but the game started freezing when Mythic Oden draw released. Also, please fix the game matching system. I'm grand master and I get matched with leyendary players on leaderboards (especially harspoint). That makes so frustrating because not everyone plays with 4 fingers. I hope you can bring back the old game matching system...",1
"Very good. However, the ""ranked"" multiplayer is mostly made up of bots which is not supposed to be the case. I wouldn't mind this all that much if they were competitive. But instead they are all either absolutely terrible and can't hit anything, or they're god-like war machines who cannot miss and will stomp you into the ground. Just make it real people in all ranked matches already.",4
"The game has come a long way from being one of; to being the best mobile game so far. Apex may have a better Battle Royale but everything else is better in CODM. Each and every aspect of the game comes our when you play different modes, maps and guns. Hats off! No complaints whatsoever.",5
"A great game with beautiful graphics to offer. However, with each update, the number of items and things on the screen have become so overwhelming that half the things are missed out on.",4
"Recently COD matches don't load anymore, it always says there's a connection issue, but I'm playing on a 5g network. I've tried everything from restarting my phone to reinstalling the app but no issue resolved. My guess is it's the game that has issues , so I've uninstalled the game, hopefully it will get fixed in the future. No choice but to play Fortnite üòù.",4
"Completely bad, bug that you can't move your camera, sensitivity is slower even you got it on max, thermites and Molotovs still meta, k8 unit bugs that you can't listen them or the map show you a position different where they really are. I don't like this game anymore, I'm gonna delet it till those things will be fixed, but is most probably warzone mobile is out than this. Terrible game as hell. (And yeah, the sensitivity and the screen issue is there even on a poco X3 pro.",1
Love the BR! The amount of camos an operators you can obtain without paying is phenomenal! The only thing I wish this game had was a better zombies mode and a campaign (maybe an evolving campaign where they release a new segment with each new season). Love the game!!!,4
Until last update I loved playing this but since the recent update game won't launch 80% of the time when using mobile data. Have tried everything including complete reinstall but still the same. 02Jun - Initially reported issue still ongoing. Unable to update app as download reaches 100% but nothing happens post that. - Finally after 12 attempts App was updated,2
I really like this game. The only thing that bothers me while playing multiplayer is that the game decides to put players in between started game. Normally I gets put into the loosing side and we loose the game which doesnt feel good. All games should start from the strat instead of middle.,4
If you are into this style of game then yes it's pretty good but however the mobile does restrict full potential of kicking butt. There is always a new season with different challenges which keeps it fresh. I don't think you will be disappointed.,5
"I don't know what happened but the game never starts on my phone when I'm on WIFI. The game randomly says server timeout. It's just not me i have seen few others have the same problem. Even if my ping is green it still lags. It's not my phone Freaking Minecraft(at max render settings) with 18 mods run smoothly. Genshin Impact , LOL , Apex Legends , Farlight 84 , Diablo , evil lands , etc. Runs freaking smooth on my Snapdragon 865 chip , 8GB RAM, 256GB ROM Game centric IQOO3 device.",1
"Loving the game since day one, just wish there was a final kill cam in Battle Royal or a kill cam for when you are killed, some of the kills that get pulled off are clip worthy while sometimes I want to see how they got me. Edit: 6/8/22, suggestion yo the development team, in Battle Royal when you look down scope on a rifle replace the movement control with a fire control it's annoying when I've lined up a shot and instead of firing I start walking....",5
"For a phone FPS the graphics are amazing and the controls are surprisingly good once you get used to them. Just wish they didn't have so many operator ""skills"" that require no skill to earn or use, and for which there is no counter.",4
There are people running around with meele weapons killing everyone because it's wierdly balanced. I still love the idea of having my favourite black ops 2 maps on mobile but at the same time I don't care about daily login rewards or skins or whatever. I just wanna play. Once you play against someone with a gaming phone with triggers you can forget about it. They don't count as controllers so they play among everyone else with touchscreens so have fun!,4
"I love this game I've had since 2019 I believe. The only issue is I'm not sure if it's my phone, but for some reason there are 3 maps I can't download without getting into for a few seconds before it kicks me out. Other than that the game is fantastic. I honestly didn't care to play at the beginning. A buddy of mine finally talked me into getting it, and I've been addicted to this since then.",5
"Pretty fun mobile game. I play Warzone on console, and this is a pretty faithful mobile representation. Battle Royale is fairly easy here, though. Not a complaint, but still, too hard and too easy are kind of the same problem. Multi-player is where it's at here for me, so I play it almost exclusively. Plenty of gimmicks meant to get you to pay, but I ignore them and it's still really enjoyable.",5
Addictive. 5***** Now only 1* because you can no longer get team chat making the game pointless...most people haven't a clue on game play and you need to talk to each other but now when you talk the opposite team can hear you making it pointless and making gameplay tactics useless. ** Also you watch adverts for rewards and don't always receive a reward. I've also opened several crates when you don't get anything from the list set out with the crates but something you already own many times.üò©üò©,1
"I kind of actually fell in love with mobile. COD has been one of my favorites for years and it's awesome that I can play it on the go! The app is good, it does use a lot of storage so you'll have to make sure your phone can handle it. I still have a ton of other apps on my phone though and it hasn't ever been an issue for me; although, I've had friends download the game and then delete it because of space issues with their phone. I recommend this app to all my friends who also enjoy the game!",4
Used to be a good game but seems like it's getting worse with each New season this ones the worst so far. Tried playing battle royale got kicked off the game 5 times in about 20 minutes. Had full signal 5g. Hate to even think about deleting game after getting the legendary and mythic guns I've gotten but definitely thinking about it,1
"Great game. I like the maps, weapons, charachters and the camos are sick. Cool characters üòé. I would like cheaper weapon unlocks. That draw for a chance thing sucks. Over 50 bucks and didn't even get the gun. Sometimes alittle leggy. But way better than most games. And nice job on the updates for new characters and guns",4
"Every time I take off to run, it throws me back. It's glitchy and I can't play BR because of this glitch. I've gotten a few shots in but no damage but if they shoot me, they hit me dead on. I can't play unless it's highjacked and I have to walk slow instead of run in order to not get thrown back. I wanna play please fix ASAP!!!",2
This game truly is fun to play. Best part is you can actually play for free without the interruption of numerous ads every time you enter another round. The game play is exciting and varied. The access to weapons is also easily achieved given time.,5
Very bad experience with the game. I had purchased 80 cod points on 31st May and the money got debited from my account but the cod points weren't credited to my account. I contacted the customer care and wrote an email to CODM but they have not responded till now. I don't know what's going to happen. One thing that I want to say is think twice before purchasing anything in game.,1
"Absolutely stunning graphics, this game has. Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è. Its been my favorite game for 2 years. But this season bugs are real annoying. The settings button get bigger automatically. And the scorestreaks button opacity gets higher automatically. Please fix asap",5
At the end of a match they only show ratings instead of kills. The killcam was once a great feature. Everyone had to watch the final kill as it was always cherished. Nowadays they show a series of boring kills that everyone skips due to a skip option they now have. If you could just make this game exactly how MW2 was then you'd be doing all of us a favor. The game hasn't been good since then on any platforms.,1
"Pretty good COD game controls are easy to use and it's very responsive to your touch.. Very fun, Alot better then I expected for sure. One issue is this games really big, uses Alot of resources and makes the game crash on lower end phones.",4
"Developers constantly ""updating"" app, making this the most frustrating game ever experienced! Absolutely zero response from developers and no results from in-game ""reports"". It's aggravating that an app with such good graphics has to suffer with so many faults. Don't plan on playing during the summer months...too many cheating punks! UNINSTALLED",1
"I have used controllers to play this game from the beginning. When I use one while game is open, it asks are you using ps4, ps5, or Xbox. Silly me for thinking ps5 actually worked. When I connect, it asks. I choose ps5 then hit multiplayer and then start. Left stick moves you, ADS and shoot buttons work, but swap weapons is button mapped to L1 and triangle throws lethal. It works on everything else except your game so it's not my devices(since I've tried multiple) and it's not the controller",1
"Listen, it's a great game but there's so much buying in-game there should be some way of earning the stuff. Secondly, I have seen several glitches and random amounts of excessive loading during use with great signal/did I. Otherwise I'd say it's a pretty good game, just can't turn up graphics to higher for some reason. Rated:Sept. 22nd, 2021 Edit: So, after succumbing to their ingame purchases I lost my account and can no longer use the account I spent OVER $400 ON. I'm not blaming them btw.",3
"It's fun. I've played it for years now, only thing I quite hate is the ads. As soon as it loads up you're faced with like 4-5 popups, constantly the game is trying to get you to spend money on microtransations, if you play ranked get ready to be destroyed by PC players, if you don't play ranked like me enjoy the game of 50/50 wether you're playing with an entire botted enemy team so you get many easy wins. It's still entertaining but it's pretty ad aggressive",3
"I really like this game. The game modes and weapons are amazing, and the game still runs quite smooth on my low-end device. Sadly, I sometimes get a black screen and have to restart the game.",4
Activision and or COD mobile has the worst customer service. Not rude. But what seems overworked and annoyed or maybe lazy. The process to retrieve your account is far from practical I personally think. And after attempts at getting my first account back to just accepting the loss. And it happened several more times. They simply quit even responding to emails. I have made 3 long invested accounts and 3 more short. The last one linked. I obviously enjoy playing.,2
"Excellent gameplay, weapons from older cod games, definitely brings me back to Black Ops 2. Also, when I win like 3 matches against noobs, I get put in with PROS AND TRYHARDS and get absolutely DESTROYED and lose. I cannot tolerate this any longer. FIX YOUR MATCHMAKING SYSTEM!",3
"Desync, rigged br with overpowered war Machine, tank, purifier etc.. still a phenomenal game for mobile so 5 stars. Edit: the game is unplayable after season 5, poor optimization, too much lag although am playing in a mid end device with snapdragon 720 and 4gb ram, moreover I've been playing on 80-100ms after this update despite having a good wifi (60mp/s). Never thought I'll quit this game but with the release of Apex ig Its time to switch (due to poor optimization)",1
"This game's anti hack methods are useless. You can't even spectate the guy that kills you. Since the last update the game crashes and doesn't even let you get past the loading screen. So for now the game is completely unplayable, and it's not my device this app did the exact same thing for a friend of mine. FIX ASAP",2
remove the thing where you suggest practicing when you lose a match. I'm not losing because I'm bad I'm losing because my teammates are bad. No I'm not full of myself it's true I get more kills than the top 2 on the opponents team combined alone but my teammates just keep dying and getting no kills. I need skill based matchmaking. Edit:happened again I'm always better than the opposing team MVP but my team is the problem whats up with that man is skill nothing in the face of persistence,2
So it says I get more rewards after tier 50. I've reached 50+ many times and never get more rewards. Been playing since the very beginning. Currently about to hit tier 70 and have not recieved anymore rewards. I feel someone that reaches that many tiers should be able to pick some of the best rewards from the battle pass because we put in time and money just not a lot of money (shouldn't matter though). Otherwise I'll stop playing at tier 50 because what's the point really?.,5
"An absolute pleasure to play, and almost addictive. The only downside is the constant push to buy packs, upgrades, pass, etc.. it's a small counterpart to having a great game for free.",4
It is excellent game. But you need to add one hip fire button in ads option so if someone wants to use both in mp matches so they can. And codm reduces rank xp for nothing. My team was 45 and the opponent 50. Still my xp was reduced. I hated it very much. Didn't expected that from codm,5
"When i play on my wifi, the game keeps on reconnecting every 10 seconds, i tried using dns changer, i changed wifi setting from dhcp to static, and changed primary and secondary dns as well, yet nothing worked. This issue has been there for 9 months now and still hasn't been fixed. Dead game.",1
"This game is an awesome the coustomization is on another level I personally like the training mode for getting better at your aim because it also has an option for bots to practice with you change the speed,the movement etc.it also has different types of modes to try from and different types of perks.You should try this game Thank you Activision",5
"Can't log in the game(connected with Facebook), the screen loads for few minutes and then it shows ""Timeout"". I use a high speed wifi and internet can't be the issue here. Needs a fix ASAP, seen many others facing the same issue.",1
"Game is a lot of fun, but performance is terrible and it's rare I don't have a day where it doesn't crash my phone a billion times, or freeze or just drop out entirely Really deters you from trying to keep playing when you can't even get the game to load",2
"Probably one of the Best Battle Royale experience out there. But COD Mobile is not only Battle Royale like other, it's much more than just a Battle Royale. There's various multiplayer competitive modes to Play with. The only issue I have with COD Mobile is it's very large & sometimes takes a lot of times to load the game, even if the internet connection is good enough.",5
"Over all this is a really fun game especially if you are bored. It does get a little irritating when there are those who wanna hack , but other than that really great gane. But I was looking forward to the pride bundle but noticed it's not available for my region, which I don't think is fair ot should be available to all regions not sure why it's not",5
"Nice new update more problems now it freezes on the main menu for about 3 min and once I finally log in, it kicks me out and I have to do over again, I like playing the game and I don't mind a few issues but constantly being kicked and now freezing its make it hard to like the game",3
"The graphics is one of the best in mobile games even among some pc games. The game is fun with lot of game modes and there is battle royal too, but the option to take your customised lodout and deploy it in the game is helps you use the lodout of your choice. There are lot of other good things about this game but the point is this game is fun shooter game with a lot of modes to play.",5
"Best Game I have ever played on my mobile! I have been playing computer games from the Atari days, and I never get bored of codm! Wish they would reduce the price of the cod points, that is the only down side (pay to win),on the plus side they do give a lot away free aswell. like everything in life you have to pay in the end!",5
"I really enjoy this game. The graphics and details are perfect. The amount of time put into this game are just amazing. Though, I do really wish instead of matching up with players your levels and ranks, I wish we could match up by Skill. If this does intentionally happen, I will give my 5th star.",4
"This is a amazing game, a fps shooter game which is very interesting and intense but as the new season came a new bug also came (sensitivity bug). A lot of players are facing it, it made the sensitivity feel higher and now I can't play as good as I used to. I hope the developers fix it soon. As this bug gets removed. I will give 5 star",4
With every new update game performance declines! I've messaged and reported game crashing for months with no response and no fix with the recent update game will crash two to three times per game and if you play ranked matches well they penalize you for their non performing game it seems as if they are more focused on adding more and more in game purchases and less focused on how the game is actually performing been playing for a while now and I'm to the point of uninstalling!!,1
Consistently dealing with server issues. The mobile game isn't connecting me to other games. I keep getting drop from matches. It's very frustrating after the amount of money I put into this series alone. I'll be uninstalling this application.,1
"Dumb things like swords, lazers and boxing gloves ruined the game for me. Not to mension the unplayable lag half the time. Multi player is pretty buggy too, and it's easy to spawn trap the other team. There was an attempt, but they missed the mark.",1
This is a super fun game with really easy controls and lots customization if you're a new or if you have been playing for a while and have your own controls that makes you more comfortable over all this is one of the best first person shooters out it's worth the download,5
"Always issues and bugs with this game. So many updates, you'd think they'd fix the existing problems like the wait time after the game loads. Staring at the screen waiting for the game to execute. Still won't spend a $1 on a busted app.",1
The game is fun but there is a problem with the pay.to.play but aside from that everything's nice and good but can you add one thing to the next update can you add Quest where you can get Cod points that would be nice instead of just buying them because are overpriced and the Bots are just annoying make them better please THX,5
"Phenomenal fps game with an easy to use UI and fantastic graphics. I would like to see more maps available for Frontlines mode and possibly higher sensitivity settings to compete with people using controllers, but those are my only complaints.",5
"The game is very good,like the old CoD's,the problem is that the game is 50/50% optimized,sometimes the fps is dropping to like 40,am playing on low graphics because i dont really see a difference in Ultra and Low graphics.And even tho i close all the background apps,my phone is 80-90% Charged,and cleaned,still the performance is chopy,and i got an Samsung Galaxy M51,but far from that,The game is FRICKING AWESOME.",4
"Bad reviews are left by folks who have no idea how processing data really works. Keep your devices up to date on software and apps. You'll be fine. Also, 5G devices are the best for the current update. Safe to say, any problems are mostly user error.",5
"Would be 5 stars, if the developer ever responded. Had issues for months. Working ok now. We'll see how it goes. Amazing game when it works. Just a bad developer, since they won't respond if you have issues. But definitely plan on losing a ton of space on your phone. Currently over 16GBs on mine right now...",4
Game is good and the graphics are great but why is this game not working on wifi every time it's updated. It's really irritating to shift from wifi to mobile data and then wifi. And is there any possibility of STORY mode ? If there is it would be really great.,4
Call of duty mobile is fun and easy to play. There is no bugs. In my opinion I believe that the battle pass should be a little bit cheaper because it's hard to keep up with the pass at times. Other than that I love the game all around,4
"After years of being a fan and a regular player it really got annoying every month with the HUGE updates. Even after a 3GB playstore update you'd get into the game and then have to download everything from Maps to operators, to skins and everything. It takes ages! And then it becomes 16GB. And it'll happen every month. Totally killed my Fun and Liking for the game.",3
"Why can't we change the camera view to TPP after somebody has selected FPP??? Oh and I'm running 4Gb ram and still experiencing lag. Like wherever I land and another person is nearby, the time it takes for a gun to load is ridiculous which makes the game less enjoyable. And the other thing is, this game freezes up everytime I encounter a person with which I assume has a much better phone than me like maybe a phone with 6Gb or 8Gb ram. please fix this technical issue. Thanks in advanceüëç",3
"Nice, this game is improve fixing and bugs and stuff. But again it fixes on problem and other arises. The storage ugh 20 freakin gb? Nah that's not acceptable. And the internet connection, it really requires atleast 40mbps + speed to run. Please try to fix these issues. Thankyou.",3
"This game was so good back in 2019-20 but now it has downgraded. My friends left this game a long time ago, now it is unplayable with randoms as matchmaking is worse in ranked but still I manage to reach legendary every season just because I wasted many pennies in this game. This game focuses more on its money gambling ecosystem rather than developing the core game. To be honest CODM is not fun anymore for me so I am thinking to leave the game for a long time.",2
"Terrible controller support, what is so hard about getting a first person shooter game to recognize that my Xbox series x controller is connected already through Bluetooth to my Samsung s20+. Laughable. This game is decent but they've apparently given up on it entirely.",5
"Game play is awesome and addictive but you cant buy what you want without spending enough to buy a game consol trying to get one skin from a supposedly random draw that tells u in fine print the odds of each prize on each draw, so that the odds you pay more than 100$ for a character ends up being near 100% because the odds of drawing the main prize (the character or the weapon) before the 9th and 20th draw, is almost non existent .",3
Its actually a decent game. I am playing this game for an year. And still not getting bored of it. And from this season onwards i am facing a little bit of lagging. So can you pls try to make it as the previous season cus that was very smooth in my device. And a bit of glitches. Still recommend this game.(you won't regret it).,5
"This season has so many bugs like enemy shown knock down but it's not, window stuck glitch,prone stuck glitch,teammates fire,walking-crunching sound like enemy,screen rotation glitch in one slow touch,all SMG aiming down,aim assist fail, sensitivity bugs mostly in br mode, wrost experience in mp mode please do something and stop ruined game.",3
"It's getting better, but the can always be improvements. I wish there was more slots that just 10 for loadouts. I have a lot of legendary and mythic guns that I can't loadout cause there's not enough slots.",4
There is connection error (4A28). Even on 200+mbps internet connection. Fails to connect to servers sometimes it even won't go past the loading screen. Before update it was working absolutely fine. Please do something about it.,2
This is now the 2nd time an update has messed the app up for me I had to un install it and reinstall the app and start pritty much over with all the little things but when I tryed to play a game all the maps had to be re downloaded and so I tryed br wile I was waiting and I get asfar as dropping out of the drop ship and once I try to deploy my shoot it shuts off every time I've tryed it 10 times now and it's all messed up I use to love this game now it's got so many bugs and it takes 4evr loadin,3
"It's a froud game with some trash people in support team..i bought some cp and a create in special offer but never got that..sent all the details, and then they didn't even reply. Game is good but please eliminate the bots from battle royal, and develop proper payment system.. Otherwise noone gonna play it for graphics only, when there is no real opponent.",1
"Since playing this game om and off over a couple years I can say it has been the best cod experience I've had since titles like warzone, bo3, and mw3. It really feels like they have brought the Chinese cod online pc game to moblie. In that case though there is a problem with P2W skins,guns,etc. I'm the from of slot machines with no real way of earning it by jusy playing the game but buying cod points with real world currency. Unlike its older titles it tries to replicate where you could earn it.",3
"PLEASE SEE THIS DEVELOPERS. Something is seriously wrong with the desperado class. The sheild turret is fine, however, there is a bug that makes you fall down TWICE AS SLOWER when you get downed. This results in not letting you use your pistol in time because you can only shoot when you're fully down, therefore making the class a little useless. Please fix the bug. This only happens when I have the Desperado class equiped.",4
"Too many technical issues ruining gameplay. I've just uninstalled it after two years. Losing games because of trash servers, glitches and bugs is not entertaining. Developers are uncapable of fixisng even simple problems with gameplay, season after season. It was ok game for a while, turned into trash last few seasons.",1
It is an awesome game playing it from over a year but one problem I faced was that when I uninstalled my game all my progress and account was deleted and had to create new account. If u uninstall the game normally ur progress is stored automatically but in my case it did not my brother also did the same thing but he had his progress and account safe I had to grind all over again but overall it's a good game,5
"Its a really fun game but the only issue is that the controls are not very smooth, its rough on some edges. Like for example shooting while turning left is hard but turning right while zoom shooting is easy.",4
"this is the best game you can get on mobile my only issue is its so big but i guess it has to be to give you that console like experience. Salute to the developers. Update beside being fun to play this game is constantly needing to download more stuff. You wait for it to download a gigabyte then when you can open the game then it needs to download 800 mbn, then when you get thru that it you can't play because it need to download the maps it never ending.",3
Always enjoy playing. Been on this for years. I would really like to see more character and weapon bundles. The draw chests are super dirt since it takes a ton of actual money to get anything good. And like really do something about all the cheaters. Thanks.,5
Please make it so that low end devices can also support high quality on the audio and quality tab please i can't play in intense situations like sniper vs sniper coz I can't see because of the quality!!! Overal my favourite game but pleaaaaaaseeeeeee!!!!!!!! Fix! The! Issue! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
I used to say this is the best mobile game till few months back.. Now it is one of the worst because of its continuous high ping issues with no improvement of the situation even afer all these updates at all!! Also Numerous Bugs.. Hackers.. Server issues.. Please dear Developers do something.. Save the game!!!!! Please!!!,2
I absolutely love this game! But for some reason when I try to connect my game to my Facebook account it comes up with an error saying my Facebook account is already connected to another player... Well that's impossible because I haven't connected it to another player! I've played this since the start of lockdown and it was like this from when I first downloaded it... So annoying!,3
COD mobile is one of the best games out there. Your able to connect through Facebook and play with friends and other people. Graphics are great. I've been playing since the release don't plan on stopping anytime soon,5
"Great app I love it, it has lots of different modes updates are awesome. But there are 2 problems 1. The extra packs are too big like the weapon camos pack is 2GB! I know there are a lot and they are HD and all but still that's a lot. 2. Whenever I try high graphics or screen record it starts to lag so I can't make videos. Please fix these problems.",4
"I love the game.. You just need enough space. I will get a memory card. I would have given 5 starts except that there is one problem. I have downloaded it successfully and I can play the game but there is no icon. I have to come to play store, search for call of duty and press play from there. Could you please help fix this?",4
Good game however the newest updates are slowly ruining it. For example one of the problems are that when shooting a person it doesn't instantly kill them because 5 seconds after shooting them that's when the game realises that they should be dead then they die. It is really getting on my nerves and needs to be fixed. I have also come across the same problem before it was updated however it wasn't this bad because after some time it went away. This also ruins my score when playing a match.,4
The game is really great and I'm still having super fun every day. There is consistent updates every month and the guns and skins are a little bit pricey but I get it you guys need to make money. 10/10 would recommend it to friends.BUT I do have one issue the ZOMBIES. I know you guys are trying to put up new content and stuff but the endless survival is a lot more fun then the undead siege.,5
Absolutely love this game. My all time favorite. No other game comes close to the quality of this game. But since the new update the game doesn't open it just hangs once i5 goes to the login. Very frustrating.,4
"I gave it 3 stars for some good reasons that needs to be fixed(1)The file size for this game is humongous & with each additional update we have to download in-game stuff which takes a lot of storage & mobile data(2)Certain bugs&balancing issues like login issue even in good internet,high ping issues,framedrops really ruins the experience (3)High preference to P2W players, the devs should add mythic/legendary gun skins available for F2P's as well for game longivity. Overall its a good fps game.",3
"Game is fantastic, recently there's been a few lag spikes in games. Please put more of a warzone feel to it for example: be able to use thermites, trip mines, cyro bomb ect. Also we need more guns please and not 1 gun a season at least 2 like come on people I know you are known worldwide but seriously it takes most of us max 3 weeks to unlock all the camos of that gun. And not ganna lie the new oden gun is pretty trash",5
"It's a great game in my obviously biased opinion, The zombie mode needs to be like the OG zombies, because it's so very lame. Also there should be a place where random people can get together in one big room with a cap of I'd say 100 ppl to start i guess, and they can battle eachother, race eachother, just shoot at targets(lame), have a target game that's earn points for an event?üòè Drive around and do flips and jumps and cool manly stuff etc.Obstacle courses, for cars and parkour courses???????",3
"The game is good in general, but it has a series of bugs, such as the example game when landing on Alcatraz a gun m4 It comes with a blue arrow and ... it will be very good to fix it, of course, the ping is irrationally high",3
"This is the best mobile game in the world. First in my opinion the graphics are amazing.Next,The audio is very Realistic and I'm glad you can change your sensitivity in this game there are also alot of maps gamemodes and guns I like the hard work and effort yall guys put in to this game And all the different Variations you guys put into the guns and all the different designs for the guns in this game overall this game is a 10/10 for me thank you for the game guys And also love the zombies mode.",5
So at first I liked this game and the community is pretty positive but the fact I spend credits to receive less credits is just ridiculous. Honestly hilarious and not in a good way. Spending 1200 credits to recieve 300 is a slap in the face for people who actually play. I think I'm done though and I honestly thought about spending money on this. Haha. This hasn't happened just once but everytime I spend credits. Bye bye.,1
I previously had given four stars now I have to change it to one. I used to really enjoy the game I did. But ever since the new update there's no reason to play. Every single match I play regardless of type Ill lag out and then suddenly die then the camera cuts to someone across the map. Ive had this game since November last year and have bought the battle pass every month and have played consistently since then but if this doesn't change I'm deleting the game,1
"I'm so angry right now...everytime I download this game it only works for a day or two before it crashes and I'm unable to login again,it keeps showing ""login timeout"" when I try to login. This will be the 6 time I'm downloading the game and this time it didn't even work at all before it crashed,it so annoying that I have to spend so much data on this and it still won't work.....you people need to fix this.üò°üò°",1
"It's Getting Better. My only 2 dislikes are: 1.) (which is no fault of Activision) is the OneUI update Android had back in December. I run on a S21 Ultra and I can't play on the fullest screen resolution (WQHD+ @ 3200x1440) without having to go into the Screen Zoom settings and upping it to 2x. 2.) Every update, you have to re-download all the maps, weapons, skins, etc. and depending on how many you have it could take another 15-30min of updating to be able to play. Other than that, solid game.",4
"Best balanced game ever! It is not pay to win and also it is not very limited for free to play either. You have enough of everything - be it game modes, rewards, grindable items and missions, difficulty levels or new maps and weapons. Brilliant example of how mobile games should be made which literally anybody can actually enjoy playing.",5
"Great game. Great app. But the downloads are enormous and take forever, especially people living in rural areas. After playing each game, you have to go through a cornucopia of different menus before you can play again. The zombie seige is great. Glad it was kept on, but it has not been updated in a while.",4
This is a superb game! No such fps drops. Amazing game play. Ultra HD graphic even with low net. Extremely realistic graphics. But your HP increases automatically to full. That is not realistic. But I recommend this game to all of you. Worth the size. Good time pass. This is not at all addicting me. A match is just for 4 to 10 minutes.,4
"it's awesome to spend a hundreds of dollars on crates and stuff just to keep getting the same camo and things you don't want just in the hopes you will get the item you want, but never get. once you get one item that you don't care about it shouldn't give you the same item again. I will not be changing my review unless they change what's wrong.",5
I love playing this game but I hate the new update with the perks. I used to have the persistence perk with my scorestreaks but got rid of it now that they've broken up the scorestreaks by 3 different ranks when you use the persistence perk...hate that I can't have my usual scorestreaks and have to pick 1 from each rank category üôÑüôÑüôÑ,4
I have a Galaxy Z Fold 2 and it is fantastic to play on the huge folding screen. Only issue is if you start the game with the screen folded or rotate the screen during game play once unfolded it zooms in and you have to quit the game and reload it to get it back to normal size.,4
"This game is great, I've been playing for 6 months now and my game experience has been amazing so far but if Activision can have more servers for the southern hemisphere then it would make the experience much better... And if they can also optimise the game for lower end devices it would be much appreciated... Keep up the good work Codm! üëç",5
"I have been playing this game for like almost 3 years and it was perfect. Even on a low end device it's pretty good. Minor 1 or 2 second lags are ignorable and they were expected. Now on my current new device it's so smooth even in 4GB RAM, the only thing to make the game smooth is by shaders preload.(For users:It is in settings <audio & graphics and then scroll down) Definitely a 5 star game",5
"Update; I could complain about the little ""luck"" we have when spinning for mythics weapons and/or operator skins. For a phone like mine, it's not bad at all, even though there is some lag in between gameplay. Otherwise, solid game, lots of room for improvement for sure.",5
"This is a garbage excuse for a game. First, no matter the mode you play, you 3ilo only play bots until you've ranked up to master; there's no fun in a game you always win against no one else playing. But let's say you finally make it up to playing other real players.... The controls are so squished together, no matter how you customize them, that the game is unplayable. I need to run, nope, guess I'm unloading my mag and giving away my position. This game is not worth the 12 GBS OF MEMORY.",2
"Its a great game for sure! Easy controls, lovely graphics and good gameplay. The only problem I have with this game is that ever since I updated it, I have been stuck on the loading screen. :/",5
"Everything is fine, except the problems with ranked matches and crashes. I'll get a ban for 5 min and 80 xp reduction? Totally uncool. Because sometimes I suffer from network problems or the game crashes for no reason in the middle of the match. So, its utterly pointless for a penalty if it wasn't my fault in the first place",3
"It used to be a premium five star game for years but now after changes made to gameplay and match rules it has become ridiculously difficult. It is apparent that the developers have given into greed and have taken ALL the fun out of this product for their players. As a player with over 1000 hours of play time, I have to disappointingly delete this game from my devices and search for a better, more fitting FPS game.",1
"Great game and the red arm flashes mean someone as old as me can still see the enemy! Unfortunately the game has been a bit glitchy lately and cooks my phone, especially when zombies is running, often freezes and puts out a buzzing sound in the audio. Downgraded to four stars because of recent issues.",4
"Nice game, but many times I have the impression that I play with bots. I do not play many games, I don't have to much experience, I still try to shot and move in the same time but still, I have 7 wins on 1st place on battle royal mode. It is too easy. All the time I killed the last player without any stress at all ... Weird ....",5
"Full of hacks and cheats, you can see them all over YouTube making videos of themselves hoping and jumping around with their auto aim like their awesome, some you can't kill, others can see you through walls. They addeda report function awhile back, but it's just to entertain you like the crosswalk button.",1
"Freezing getting kicked out of games, every since the up date game is slow, lagging, and freezing. I don't understand why it was playing perfect before the update now Im losing in contest because I'm being booted. This needs to be fixed",1
This upgrade is useless am unable to log onto cod after the upgrade I think no one should get the upgrade it way more useless unless they can retify the issue after wasting that much data to get the upgrade it totally useless try to fix the issues I mean why update the game when it actually results to crashing,1
"Call of Duty and what a classic! Omg playing nostalgic maps, as my life has been on the go. The control scheme however is amazing, the ability to switch between ADS and hipfire would be a help, however for a free call of duty mobile game to boot, you are not going to go wrong spending some time on this beautifully redesigned version that the Call of Duty franchise has created for mobile.",4
"The game play in Battle Royale mode is fun. But not really when others are using hacks. Spoils it completely. There's too much hype about the Multiplayer modes, they are way too fast paced. Spawn in Ranked Matches is bad when spawned just to be instantly tsken out without any chance to react. The Rank and level up doesn't reflect skill at all. It's easy to level up and rank up by just spending the time to do so. Almost everyone becomes a Level 150, Legendary. The chat zone is very toxic. Fix it.",3
"This game is one of the best Battle Royal game. I love this game. Its a 5 star from me. But there is still a problem which is the app size, its getting bigger every update plus all the resources we have to download afterwards. Its occupying 13 GB in my phone! After some time i wont be able to play it anymore becuz of its huge app size. I would recommend removing some guns, gun skins, character skins, perks etc.",5
"The game is great but ever since the latest update,occasionnally whenever I start the game it says timed out,and I have tried to restart it,switch on/off the aeroplane mode for better connections,even change the mobile networks to 2g and then back to 4g/3g/2g preferences and it still doesn't work,when this first happens after retrying so many times and it didn't work I have to wait for about an hour or less and then it worked and then the second time it happened I only had to try once, it works.",3
"This is the best Multiplar fps game on mobile, the graphics are just realistic but there is a little bug after playing free for all, multiplayer mode so it shutts down my phone, the game runs smoothly but when it shows the results it freezes them restarts my phone, help please",3
The progress of a mobile gaming app has increased so much you can take Grand theft Auto and stuff it on your phone you can take call of duty and stuff it on your phone I can't believe how immersive the gameplay really is and easy to learn the controls and become good. It's nice that everybody has a mic now no excuses turn on your mic. Fun that you can play with people around the world. Only con is that I am not good at sniping.,5
I used to like this game until it basically became a fornite clone that people can pay to win. The skins and themes are annoying. The animations are super annoying too. Nothing like the original CODMW. Suck at playing? No problem just buy the good gear with perks and buffs and you'll win MVP pretty much always. As far as the mechanics go: It's solid. I would only add that passengers in vehicles can fire too. CODs evolution and clear appeal to the fornite crowd is just outright sinful,2
"Pay to win, to an extent, fun though. Most of the game modes are extremely similar and repetitive. HUGE file and update sizes. Zombies and ground war are the best modes and they got rid of them. After that, I stopped playing.",1
Update bugs on my Samsung Note 10+. Update screen remains still for hours and I can't see the download progress. Very frustrating. It would have been a five star rating otherwise. Update: problem solved and the game is running smoothly now. Back to 5 stars. Thanks a lot.,5
Im crazy in love with this game. Time flys by when your in it to win it. üòÜ I just would like to see more jetpacks snowboards and pets. It would be kool if our pets would drag the injured for to revive and if you can personalize coustomize . Also if the credit store gets updated more often. And not bring old characters back. It's would be Kool if you can change their outfits . Other than that this is a great game.,5
"Since after the latest update I'm trying to update the game but everytime after getting 100% downloaded the update doesn't get installed and it starts to download again from the starting, I have tried to uninstall the game and reinstalled it many times and also I have downloaded the game from outside the google play and whenever I try to start the game it shows ""SORRY THERE WAS AN ERROR DURING GOOGLE PLAY DOWNLOAD, IF U CAN'T SOLVE IT GO TO THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE OR COMMUNITY PAGES FOR HELP"".",2
Many enemies slew but I keep it to the game. Games dont cause violence. This game has taught me team building and fun. One of the GOATs in the gaming world!! COD forever!!!! Only thing I ask. Make hardcover mode permanent pleaaaaaaase!! Best mode.,5
Great game!!! For a shooter game on your phone it doesn't get much better than this. For me it was about getting the controls setup right for how I play. Setting up my custom controls helped me more than anything.,5
"Since I went to Google play store to stop auto update, to login to the app it require password when I try to login and I don't remember it coz I always use auto login and I can't reset it, I try to check my email there's no massage from COD Mobile to help me resolve my issues. Finally my friend helped me to login via Facebook no problem. Back to square one üò™ any help? I can't login. Via Facebook back to the game üëç. Ups and downsüòì",3
"One of the best mobile shooting games I have ever played, I have played almost all the COD PC games so, I knew that this would also be a total banger in the mobile gaming market. Amazing graphics, no lag, no crash. A total A1 game Activision has made. Never expected to get this type of experience in smartphones after playing PC games. LOVED IT MANNNN!",5
I honestly want to give this game more stars but the glitching and crashing in the middle of matches had been going on for years now and they haven't fixed it. Glitching is a problem and it takes the fun away,1
"Graphics look okay abiet textures are low res. Even on a modern phone the game stutters like crazy (even when compiling shaders) Audio is low quality (even with high quality audio pack installed) Controls can be often times confusing Constant annoyances ex: ads, battle pass, microtransactions, etc Not a bad game it just could use a bit of polish to improve the experience",3
"I use to enjoy playing the game, but now when ever I play, the game just shuts down and I have to rejoin in the middle of a match, or I'm banned for the 5 minutes and loosing xp. If it continues I'm sorry to say I will be deleting the game and giving one star. It get old and very tiring hoping that I'll be able to finish a game.",2
"If this game fixed these,very single time I try to destroy the chopper gunner boom instantly dead, no matter how many times I will keep on respawning I will always see the death screen, making me lag, this game is so bad for low end devices, this game wod be 100x more enjoyable if low end devices would have a chance. And plus once I get into a game after a really long time of not playing, I will lag game after game after game. CODM fix this because this is ruining my gaming expierience of codm.",1
Negatives. Most matches I get killed before I can even lift my gun. It looks as if I get killed with 2 bullets but video replay shows them shooting at me for seconds. Also I shoot at them almost a whole magazine with bullets and they don't die. I have been told in forums that some of this is due to fault of Cod servers. Otherwise its a good game.,2
This game could be fun. But dont waist your time. The lag. The shity servers. Cant connect. Yeah sure. Fun game. EDIT. Read every review. You will start to see. This game is a problem. You will be lucky to play 3 full games. If. They blame your device. I guess 90% of the devices are just to weak. No. It's the servers. I cant rate this game any past 1 star. Until these issues are fixed. Hahaha. Good luck with that. O. Edit. Thanks season 5 update. I lost all my data after update.,1
First off favorite mobile game of all time. But the new season is a rip off you can't see enemies until it's too late!!! ppl with (special characters rarely die) if you win a few games back to back (the game start putting you in random losing games) which give you a bad battle history...my rank is a (grand master 1 but only one bullet needed to kill me from any gun.....how is that possible when my gun came in the top 40% of all players....this season suck,3
It's an awesome game. I hope they can fix the lag in ranked matches and also the bug where the player after being killed still shows like he's alive in the game.,4
"A great time for me. Only thang is missing is the Rangers, Delta Force, US marines, SEALs, CIA, GIGN, and Spetznatz. Other characters/maps from WaW, WW2 Aw, and IW would be nice to see here. And why not? Throw in some characters and maps from the CoDs on DS! I get there is no campaign, but I would like to see Spec Ops: Missions, Survival, and Chaos, all with co-op. But the game feels so smooth, and it is really rewarding at its best, and laggy at its worst. I can gladly say this is awesome!",5
"Can finally say that the game has improved , faced very little lag as well as frame drop on Max graphics which is pretty admirable if you compare it to the previous seasons , Balanced guns are still somewhat of a issue in the game . The only issue that remains is the false ban issue , pretty much faced by every good player , Players just report you just because you are playing better than them. Another thing i would like to add is Increased Time to kill (TTK). Around 300-350 ms should be good .",4
"Got addicted and played it so much that gave me the ""gamer's thumb"". Best multiplayer shooter game innthe market currently no doubt about that. The creaters are doing a great job keeping the public engaged by providing regular updates and fixes. Also the new maps, gameplay modes along with the traffic control on the server is absolutely amazing.",5
"Great stuff! Since my last review u guys have done an outstanding job at fixing everything it's understandable that ur still working bugs out which is cool because I figured out a way too if people have issues, like if u haven't turned ur phone off for 2 weeks while constantly playing the game u run into glitches so all u do is turn phone off for 5 minutes turn it back on an ta da presto! Ur at full speed an no glitches runs perfect after that! So thank u guys very much for making this game!",5
"It was a good game. But the last update had destroyed it completely. The earlier versions run very smoothly in my phone, but this version is lagging so much in low graphics and frame rate. I don't know why, may be because of some bugs, may be. Now I don't like playing this game at all. I have uninstalled this game.",3
"Glitching like a mofo lately. Recently upgraded to a Note 10 plus on a Tmobile network. It worked flawlessly in the first 2 months, now I don't get to finish games. This is happening more often and to more people with great phones......Update:05-31-2022 Game has been working with no issues, seems like updates are working as they should.",4
"The game itself is great, its the people playing it that need to calm down and just have fun. Most games I play there's always this one player that just don't let anyone else have fun to level up as they constantly keep spawn killing, one shot sniping running around etc. In the gaming term ""sweaty players"". I stopped playing at a time due to it not being fun to constantly get spawn killed like 5 seconds after I spawn, I come back to the game and nothing has changed with the players :/",4
"Okay so I loved the game. But it's the same stuff over and over, with all the dang space it takes up. Should have add a campaign mode like it's on the Ps4 or Xbox. And it takes up almost 15gigabits on my phone! Just so it can still lagg and freeze up from time to time. I downloaded PUBG new state and it's only 1 1/2 gigs . I'm about tired of COD Mobile. Fixn to Delete and Not pay for something that's starting to waste my time waste of time and space. And I took a screenshot shot just in case",3
"I got my account back so, I like this game again, however there are too many bots that at times can make the game way too easy, it's not as bad in ranked and casual matches but BR is infested with easy bots. and two, instead of the zombie mode on there now, it needs major improvement it feels like some unfinished fps version of a tower defense game. Other than those two things this is a great game and the only CODs i've played that is still fun.",4
COD gives a good gaming experience and one of the best time killing games. But the storage keeps on increasing and phone temperature raises even when using 6 gb ram. Developers should try to optimize the game a lot.,4
"The game is amazing but too many things are making less fun. Loading Timeout, glitches and all. And please Battle Royale map is getting boring, with all the upgrades every now and then, please make a new map.",5
Ok to start off this game is a great call of duty game not much campers and faster matches. The reason it is 3 stars is the storage space and the game loading and updating speed. It takes about 30 minutes just to update per season I can litterally watch yt for 20 minutes and it will still won't be done. If they can speed up servers or maybe send out smaller updates just more frequently that would make this game 5 stars.,3
"controls are easy and intuitive, and despite being a mobile game that, on paper, wouldnt work well, its the complete opposite. its a fun experience and you can still have fun even when abiding by the game's countless paywalls. did i mention its free?",5
"The game is overall very good game. It is famous for it's different MP modes and great experience in BR. One of the best Action games right now from every segment... But plz reduce the size of the game.. It has exceeded more than 11 GB. Conpress the game size within 6-7 GB. It will be alright for every gamers. Apart from that, Plz fix the issue high ping and server issue .The game sticks at one place sometime inspite of having good network. Improve your server latency.",3
"Graphics are amazing and the overall performance and optimization is great on my phone. My only mild complaint is that I'm more skilled than my level, meaning I'm constantly going from first place in a low level match to 2nd or 3rd on a high level match and still being sent back to low level matches. There should be a feature to choose match rankings higher than yours and to maybe give an increase in xp, levelling etc for those who do",3
"What I liked the most we have lot of Arenas to select and more weapons, we can customize weapons according to our requirements very good UI and graphics. I like to play Multiplayer all the time, they use to design different challanges in different arenas. We will get it in Featured in multiplayer mode.",5
MP and Ranked suck because there are always either bots on my team and tryhards or one out of 10 times the game will actually put some people off similar skill/rank on the same/opposing team. It's very unfair how many times I lose because of bad the matchmaking is in the game.,1
"Been playing the game over a year now and I never had any issue with it till the last season. Even after the update Miami strike update, my game lags a bit which never happened before. It's just makes ranked really bad as it lags when I'm shooting and has limited my fun while playing the game. Hopefully a solution cause it's really needed.",3
"I used to play this around when it first came out on my S9, it ran great then. I didn't play it for a couple years after that because I got busy. I got it back on my S22 Ultra a couple weeks ago. Just wow, it looks insanely good on my phone, and runs extremely smooth. I would highly recommend to the people out there who love FPS and some classic COD.",5
"I absolutely love this ‚ù§ üéÆ I play it every single day, I love everything about it. My only problem is ... I've spent quite ALOT of money on this game and when buying on the draws it only gives you the lower prizes I don't think iv ever won a good gun. I'm not spending ¬£5 or above to just get a wing suit. Very disappointing. But other than that, all round fantastic!!",5
"The game is good, but takes too much of space, 16 GB is way too much, the games has to be optimised, there's no need of so many multiplayer maps, unnecessary data, which is used rarely.",4
"The best mobile game I have ever played. Great graphics and the game has a lot of stuff to offer for a mobile game. I would not recommend playing on older Devices, and playing on well used devices. I had a 2021 phone that I did nothing but play codm on and the game started to lag and glitch in about 6 months of owning the phone. But other than that I would highly recommend this game. It may be free but there are plenty of micro-transactions in the game.",5
"I have playing this since 3 years on both High and Low end handsets. But the recent updates have left the game with lots of Bugs. All gameplay lags a lot like never before. I have to uninstall this because I thought COD is aware of the issue happening all over, very disappointing",1
I have found this game to be very challenging as well as thrilling .It enables me to become childlike in a sense.without the mechanics of real danger. It seems to me that when young people these days play these very controversial games it leaves a certain mark on their minds that misleads them into believing that the violence that is programed into the games are a reflection of this reality that they are producing for themselves.i find this to be very disturbing and it's up to us to be better.,5
"The game is good, really good, stop messing with it. I logged on today and experienced nothing but lag. It is annoying and unenjoyable when I can't move to shoot because I'm moving in slow motion and get destroyed every match. This is a "" mobile game "". If I wanted all the extravagant gameplay I'd log on to my console. This game was fun and enjoyable, now it's just frustrating. I'm playing on a higher end device and still experiencing these issues. Make CODM great again. It's a mobile game.",3
"Desert storm back back used to be cool all grey geometric shaped, but turned into regular back pack orange stripes and grey. Quit playing game after that. Could get skins I loved but changed after updates not the 1st time that's happened. Wouldn't pay for this game anymore. Especially, after launch scam experience when game 1st came out.",1
"As mobile games go, this is by far one of my favorite gaming experiences. I hope to see you on the battlefield! Addendum: as of the new season seems they messed with the scorestreaks so if you wanted to use them you've now been limited..... I don't know of why they did this it's just angering...",5
I really recommend playing this game it has really good graphics and everything you would want in a gun game. But I do wish they could lower the price for the draws/redux. I also wish they could make the game to where it doesn't need so much GB to update the game so you don't have to delete other games or apps or photos.,5
"So I like it, I really do. Something is wrong though and it's taking away from my enjoyment of the game. In multiplayer, my team's kills aren't counting. They just stop counting out of nowhere or start later than the other team, and the other team gets to surpass us and win. It's not right and it's incredibly frustrating. It's happening more and more often. Please fix this as soon as you can.",3
"I've been playing this since it's release, and it's come a long way. Graphics are awesome, controls are easy to understand and not sloppy. I just wish something could be done with the cheating. The consoles have tricks to combat this, why doesn't mobile?",4
Absolutely horrible update!!! Why do you guys mess up the settings after every update?!! The sensitivity for all the guns has completely changed and there are so many hackers now!! And the fix the damn ping issue! I have lost over 300 xp in ranked matches due to high ping issues!! Absolutely sucks!!!! Edit: the latest update which was 2 days ago is the worst by far! Just when I thought it couldn't be possible!! Uninstalled after religiously playing for 9 months!,4
This game is so awesome! The graphics and gameplay are comparable to COD on a console or computer. There is always someone online to play with and there are a variety of maps and weapons to make this a very exciting and fun game! Definitely recommend 100%,5
The game needs a big update. Every time I'm playing battle royal the app keeps crashing and if I'm not getting kicked it's lagging. At a distance I cannot see other players at a distance but they can obviously see me since I'm being shot at. Also can see helicopters or other vehicle until they have gone by or I'm getting hit. I have played this game for years and loved it but recently it's just been a waste of space on my phone.,2
"I' d give it a 4 star rating, but I'mma have to settle with three. The game has just been a playing grounds for toxic players, cheaters or hackers. I use to be good at the game and be able to have leveled amounts of wins and loses. But now, ya can't even last 2 seconds without someone either using melaes or camping in a corner killing you. Hate to sound like those types of players, but I missed those days of honest play in COD games. But honestly, I even think mobile is more toxic than warzone",3
It doesn't get auto login as before and everytime I attempt it gets stuck in downloading resource file and it shows timeout on my screen. And it keeps repeating!! Do fix this issue ASAP.,1
For several seasons this game has had issues crashing on the menu. I understand that you wanna make sure there's no reason to complain about unbalanced weapons but maybe let people play the game.,1
"I just simply love this game.. Thank you so so much.. It has more then your or anyone's requirements.. From graphics to gameplay to modes and maps everything is absolutely perfect üíØ.. You can easily learn and eventually become a pro also.. Every month with battle pass and special events you get different characters to different emotes and all.. Thus, as mentioned earlier it's just simply PERFECT AND AWESOME GAME üòÄ",5
"Overall Cod is a wonderful shooting game those who play solo and also those who play with friends. One thing though, please bring back ""Undead seige"". The new season doesn't have it. I loved the challenge it gave.",4
"UPDATE 3: CONSTANTLY RECONNECTING BOUNCING ALL OVER THE F'N MAP!! FIX IT!!! UPDATE 2: Latest update renders the game COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE!! UPDATE: Damn game keeps lagging. Disconnecting/reconnecting over and over. FIX IT!!!! Old review: It's like if you married MC:5 and PUBG, lol. I think the Battle Royale could use more maps, but it's fun nonetheless. I think I might like this a bit more than PUBG, though PUBG does have more maps. With time, I think this game could topple both MC and PUBG.",1
"I think COD mobile is one of the best mobile fps out there thanks to its simplicity. However, it be better if the gunsmith was replaced with pick 10, the audio was updated (firing sounds, reload sounds, and hitmarker sounds), and incorporate the guns from other titles. For example, if you wanna have a FAMAS, then add a fan favorite FAMAS, like the Black Ops 1 version, you get the idea. Newer maps from other cods can also be good, and universal controller support. Other than that, 4 stars. Solid",4
This game is really exciting and filled with thrilling places and environments that you have to travel to and that won't be a problem with the wide variety of vehicles that you can find all over the map. This game also gives you a wide variety of guns much big then fortnites 6 or 7. So should you get this game f*** yes,5
"I was downloading your game and when ever everything in the game was fully loaded up as it is, the screen goes all the way to the top left of my screen. I need this fixed because i want to play the game after i haven't for so long, so please fix this.",1
"Overall a very polished and mostly complete cod experience. Rivals and often exceeds the amount of content offered on the Mainline titles. Really the only thing it's missing is zombies which is the only reason I'm not rating it higher. The controls are a little wonky and if you play with a controller you will most likely destroy the enemy team because there is a decent amount of bots and everybody is pretty bad, since most people don't play with a controller. The game is decently well optimized",4
"F**king love this game. Its really decent for a mobile version, controlls are also adjustable and at least there are many modes and maps to play in, ive been playing for almost 2 years know and its always entertaining and live matches are decent. I just wish when the signal cuts out that you dont get penalised for getting kicked off a match, considering the lost connection isn't intentional.",5
"Ever since I uninstalled and reinstalled the game to attenpt to fix crashing errors, I haven't been able to login to my account through Facebook, so I have pretty much lost my account. It keeps giving me an authorization failed error. Please fix this then 5 stars again. Love the game overall though... just would like the authorization error fixed",5
"Best Game for Phones and Tablets!! It's not pay to win. No adds. Zombies 20 player needs to be made a core game, im sick of waiting for it. How hard would it be to have massively multiple warfare? Like a re-enactment of the trenches in WW2?",5
"The game is overall a nice game but the only problems are that on low end devices with less than 2 or 3gb ram have a freeze during gameplay if there where more optimization features that wouldn't give too much of a edge for other players to don't have a low end device, but if low end devices are going to run the game to at least more than 30 fps or a steady lock on 30 fps you will need to add more optimization features disabling particles, lowering shaders, and lowering textures.",5
"Must link account. Deleted Facebook prior to connecting a different login source, lost my account I had since pre-registration. No legit steps for account recovery if uninstalled then later installed. Had to restart without the account I used for purchases, and in-game progress. Overall, fun game, well balanced for all levels of gamers to enjoy. Free to play, certain items require purchases (pay to play NOT required). Zombies mode is weird though. Losing my old account = the low rating!",2
"Over 2 years with this game now since the beta release in Australia cause I didn't have the patience to wait for world wide release. Crazy thing is I like the game more now then 2 years ago and I still play quite a bit, for a mobile game it's the sh$$, honestly it's the only one I have played more then a handful of times. Constant updates and new seasons monthly keep things fresh and gives game purpose other then just embarrassing those who think they can challenge theManiac-Hittman..NUKE EM!!!",5
"This is a really great game, if you have a good phone you shouldn't have lag or glitches that often. The only thing is it takes ALOT of space. Like 15 GB. Other than that I like to mees around and try different guns, even though im told that most of the ""players"" are bots, I still think its fun. I wish their could be modifications for melee weapons, and RPGS.",5
Newest update won't allow me to boot the game. Got it booted once since update. Now won't allow me to do anything past login screen. Just freezes on the loading screen. Kinda chapped about the situation considering I have the battle pass that's being wasted now cause I can't boot the game. Now out money cause the battle pass.....,1
"Loving it so far, thanks! An update to this, the updates are getting worse in size and frequency. Also, what happened to changing views in BR? Thanks for fixing that. I have seen several requests to have the zombies from the original game to be brought back and would like to agree, that would be excellent.",5
This is the worest game I've ever seen .... Every time you open it . it's updating what the h...l you update every single time i open it what is the important new feather you update every time..... Why i have to what all of this time to just start up the game..... Updating is agood option but when it's not too much.... It's a double edged sword üó°Ô∏è,1
Great game. But why does my razor kishi controller not work. I don't own an Xbox. So could you guys get around to supporting it? Shouldn't need blue tooth to connect a hard wired controller! It's designed for Xbox! No reason why it shouldn't work. Pissed off! üò°,1
Constant lags during the gameplay makes it difficult to enjoy. You've added countless new features to make it fun and thank you for getting us through the pandemic but now you keep building on top while the foundations are showing cracks. Please fix it ground up. Pause new features or modes. Work the foundation.,3
"After last update, game periodically freezes on login background. Today I haven't been able to get on at all. Several attempts and nothing but intro music and a picture.",1
So basically this game is fantastic but I have a few tips to improve it. 1: So please add different types of bullet that effect the damage and speed of the fire. 2: You should add more events and also some credit events because it is really difficult to get credits. 3: Please add more guns. 4: Battle ground is good but please add some more feature to it and graphics are good but it would be nice if you made it the best. That's all for now if I have a few more tips I will let you know.,5
"Everything was good about this game. But now from the past 3 weeks I'm facing an issue. Despite having a very good internet connection this game says unable to download configuration make sure u are connected to internet. What the hell do you mean,,,,,I'm connected to a freakin 5G network. I'm genuinly frustrated now. I've missed my important tournaments because of this problem. Please fix this.",2
This a a good game but sometimes the games is just hang and everything just work.If I am updating the game this game take a lot of time.My wifi works so properly but sometimes this game ping goes to 199ms and it frustrates a lot when you are in ranked and battle royale game. Otherwise if these things were not in the game I would love this game so much. That is why i am giving it 3 stars.,3
Absolutely love this game. The season passes are worth it. The controls are simple and easy. The skill level is evenly matched. And the game modes are tons of fun. I've had this game for 3 or 4 years now and I love it. Thank you for the game. Honestly I have played this more than I've played console call of duty's. If you're looking for a call of duty experience on the go this is the game.,5
As soon as I go onto the game. It Downloads more mega bites or gega bites. I'm sick and tired of this game. It just like I don't know I just hate it cuz it's like literally no reason just to keep on downloading more megabytes or gigabytes cuz like though I mention that like two times and then second reason is just as soon as I go into the Battle Royale it just lags so much I can't even freaking going to my inventory and heal myself matter of fact it literally takes me at least 5 minutes to- 1/3,1
It's good actually different and unique this game is the most action packed game I've ever played on mobile the graphics are amazing even on Android and or IOS it's a really good game and it can be very addictive. I could tell there was a lot of effort put in to this. I definitely recommend this game üëç,5
"I really like the game but each update the game faces a new kinda bug. First time the app kept closing out of nowhere. Like at least twice in a BR match so by the time I reconnect I might hv already died. Now that doesn't happen, instead I can't see enemies or vehicles outside a 20m radius(sometimes even closer). In multiplayer I can hear absolute nothing except the teammates' audio. Be it the countdown, footsteps, shooting. It's starting to get annoying. Honestly I still dk why I play it.",2
"Its a fun game and all and im an og, but one huge problem that makes all of us F2p players mad, on the main event, there is a free karambit - shipwreck that is so bugged, if you equip it on mp, you cant see it. Its just base melee. But for some reason on br you can see it. Its rare to get a free karambit in your game but you guys really messed us up. Please fix this glitch",5
"I wish I could give this game 5 stars but the developers just dont deserve it now. Brand new season and there's more bugs than EVER! EXTREME lagging, ""server connection errors"" and now the screen TOTALLY blacks out during Battle Royale games?! During fueds?! Come on. It's what, the 4th season already? Every update seems worse than the last. UPDATE: Last sentence from 4/1/20 is still true.",1
"To be straight with you, codm is the best game I've ever played, I would have given it five stars, it must be earned. There are some certain things, that are so wrong with codm, and we need u to help us fix these things. Like considering low end devices users, by making us see opponents from afar, with their skins and other things necessary. Lastly, it's like you don't even check our previews, and that means u don't give a dawn about what people thinks about ur games, and . Pls make ammendments.",4
"Gameplay is awesome, controls and graphics work great. However there's too much stuff, it feels cluttered and theres always some kind of update or dwonload. I miss the simplicity of when the game first came out. Bring back the zombies and leave it be.",3
The game says players who use controllers will only be matched with other players using controllers. That is FALSE! You need to fix this. It is noticeable when you play a game and someone is using a controller an when it comes to aiming it is Extremely unfair to those who play with our fingers. It's a mobile game not a gaming system. When updating we should only have to download the update not the entire game again.,3
"Although the game is pretty addicting once you get used to it, there are some couple of things however. Overpriced lucky draws. I'm fine with how much money it costs to get a certain amount of CP what really gets me annoyed is the fact that how far the next spin of a certain thing is. Im a kind of person that loves to buy draws and all those sorts of stuff but when you look behind on how much money you have spent into this game it is really disappointing. Overall the draws are overpriced.",2
"Hey that new karambit from the water pump gimic that's going, well in game it only shows up as the base knife. And it doesn't show up as a blueprint only camo, either way it would be nice to actually use it since I don't have the thousands and thousands to put out to get one from the GOTYABOX. THANKS üëç WILL FIX WHEN ITS FIXED",1
"It is a horrible experience, It is extremely laggy, they used to have very nad quality textures graphics and everything in 2019, if they could provide that quality but on the lowest graphics, itd run much better so that I would actually keep playing this game more often",2
"The game is great, and the people that play the game are great to. So why did i pur 3 stars. Well more than half of the time the matchs are not even\fair meaning That i was queueing up and there was a level 100 plus in the same lobby as me that was not on my team. The teams are unfair. The game stops and lags alot. It should be more lower budget devices friendly if that makes any sense. I love the game just fix those two issues please!",3
New update. Optimize the game please. Since the beginning of the season sounds are shutting off as I'm in matches. Can't really try to climb leader boards like this. And why do all the characters look like generic characters? Sounds are definitely shutting down in matches! Optimize the game please. PLEASE UPDATE AND FIX THE SOUND ISSUES. LOSING ALL SOUND IN MATCHES!!,1
"This game is great at all but from 2 or 3 seasons ago,the game's graphic became so bad and my lag and freezes became so much more and 1 star is because of it This is my favorite game.Activision never doesn't care about players with weak phones and makes its games fans to go and play another game Please do something for us with weak phones to play COD:Mobile again...update:nothing is changed after 9 months,Activision has to do somthing for low-end devices",1
"Amazing game, but it has a lot of problems for example the new season: The sensitivity sometimes breaks and I can't move my screen the meta guns are broken and should be nerfed and a lot of bugs like the karambit skin not showing up please fix these damn bugs.",5
"I started playing this in 2019 and it was a great game.Over the years it has gradually got worse due to poor updates and the ability to cheat during game play.The game is now full of annoying glitches.I feel the developers have become desperate for ideas and ruined a great game trying too hard for improvement. Such a shame.After another few months of game play and more updates this game is almost unplayable now. I also can't believe how many updates are required,I've had 4 updates in 4 days.",1
"First. I love COD in general. I was a HUGE Black Ops and Black Ops II nerd. In my opinion, I think this is better than those two games! Well, unless you want to play zombies- that's not included. It's convenient to have the game ready to go in your pocket. I play mostly with my XBOX One controller through Bluetooth and it works GREAT! BTW, I 100% recommend getting the Season Pass. You have 1 month to unlock everything AND earn enough COD Points to buy the next Season.",5
"Great game, but too much lag, now I have a new issue where my left control sometimes just stops working... Fix the bugs please üòí... it's 2022 and the touch screen controls are still not working, fix this please",2
"They don't let you play ranked with a controller during competitions. However, those with computers use bluestacks to simulate android and use a controller. How is this fair? I'm playing with a controller on my phone. Not a giant screen. Please consider fixing this. I would love to compete in competitions. Thank you.",4
Need to support 3rd party controllers üéÆ i have a couple other controllers I like to take for travel while using emulators retractable controller are for better for phones and I am not able to use them. Would like to see this implemented in 2021. Still no 3rd party controller support 2022,1
What the hell have you made after the update.... It doesn't login at once need to restart the game multiple times ... Sometimes it login via wifi sometimes via mobile data and sometime it doesn't move past the login screen Fix these bugs,1
So usually it works like a charm. But since today it's just unable to actually start the gameplay! No matter what it is! They're saying network connectivity problems. I am watching videos on 4k and there's enough network for that but not for CoD?! My rank actually decreased because the battle royale didn't start but somehow i lost it.,4
Playing on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and wish you would optimize it for the full screen! Playing on here stretches out the graphics so names and text are blurry. The game runs perfect other than that.,3
Love this game it's a lot better than playing it on a console the graphics are excellent there is a couple of issues that are annoying especially when you firing at someone and they disappear for a second or so I've been killed a few times because of it apart from that 10/10 for the game as a whole,5
Great gameplay. I just wish they would quit starting me in games that have already started. I shouldn't have to be responsible for turning a losing game prior to my arrival to turning it into a win. It rarely works out that way when its already 22 to 2.,4
"The best fps game we could get on mobile And, I would like to give 5 stars but there is a problem in the game that when you open the game first 2-3 times it opens correctly but at 5-6 time it does not open it says download configuration failed! Though I am having a good network. I tried everything it is not opening. This is the problem I got, otherwise game is fantastic. Please solve that problem Thank you",4
Please optimize this game for Samsung Galaxy s22 Ultra. The game is very laggy even at minimum graphic setting. This game is great on iOS btw. It seems to only effect the 128gb version of the s22. I am on the 512Gb version with more RAM and the lag is very minimal. However There is a delay of sound when I am on Bluetooth. it's about a whole second delay. Please fix this.,2
"I've been playing CODM from day one, it was all good no issues but as the upgrades started coming and I have to download my soldier, weapons, camo,maps etc all over again, it's frustrating and you don't have to be an upgrade almost every month.. the game is taking half of my storage rn.. And very important WHY THE LAGGING ITS SO FRUSTRATING WHEN EVER IM BEING SHORT AT THE GAME FREEZES .. its bad for we gamers. Pls look into all this pls I really love this game and I want to continue playing it.",3
"This is legitimately call of duty, and it's free! Same maps from several other call of duty's, same feel and highly populated. Haven't been getting ads either, which is huge nowadays with mobile games. I recommend getting a game controller for your phone, but it's still plenty fun without.",5
"2 Stars for classic CoD gameplay, Rest of it is automated Ad machine with lootboxes. There is no option to get rid of annoying pop ups.Wait...there is actually...unistalling. Just get classic CoD on Consoles or Pc.",2
"As a diversion to normality its great, you don't need to spend a lot on it and the controls are easy enough. Cheap and easy fun, whats not to like.",5
Not able to login using Facebook id in which I was playing for years After latest update. Shows Authorization error. Please help. PS: Fixed NVM You morons have made the game establish dependancy on the FB app rather than online login...what kind of morons are you. I can't play if I don't have fb app???,1
"It's a good game through and through and I love playing it but for real? FIX THE DEFULT SKINS GLITCH!! I can't see other peoples skins or weapon camos when playing and it's annoying, I loved that you could see other peoples skins in the game. Now you have to download hella sketchy stuff and not this version to actually see them. Its sad.",3
"Unable to login...it's showing me a massage ""please prohibit third party plugins and apps"" but I am not using any....customer care is not responding.... I don't know what to do. I am not going to play this game ever in my life, it has blocked my account for no reason. I have lost my every achievements, progress. #Worst game. I want to give 0 star for this.",1
I've been playing this game going on 2 years now and I can say without a doubt it's the best you gonna find when it comes to mobile game play I tell you.. Only issue tho is the amount if space it takes up on my device it's like every 3rd update I'm required to get a new and better phone to keep up one of these days many people will no longer be playing not because they don't like it but because they devices are not compatible.Ontill then I'm gonna continue playing on a daily.,4
"The game is ok. Mechanics are easy & comfortable to manage, there are a lot of weapons, cool items for short OP. PvP is pretty fair which is unusual for FPS in general. Placing comics in game is very cool idea. I wish there was more PvE events or missions. But nothing thrilled me for real in this game, was quite boring.",3
"Newest update is running smoothly but I don't see any reason as to why Tengu's original voice got replaced by some other character's voice? Please restore Tengu's original voice, it would suck if he doesn't have his original voice. It's the appearance, voice, and style with which the player gets used to, when playing with a certain character. I myself, had been playing with Tengu for more than a year, now finding out that his voice got replaced just breaks my heart.",4
"After this recent update, the game experienced the most balanced mata but it became too tough to play this game on low end devices. The processors are not able to run this game properly and the most annoying thing is that the low fps. It is just impossible to compare with the players playing on high end devices even we have more skills than them. Please make the game atleast playable in low end devices.",1
"Its been 3 years playing this game but i didn't get boared its my 3rd I of this game the graphics are super fantastic the gun are really awesome and their attachment the damage,recoil,ads movement is really balanced according to gun which is sign of a perfect game but its not on top there's that ff and all which I don't like but get better and perfect salute to Activision. Bye",5
"Thanks call of duty for listening to some of my advice. Like making it possible to swim down anywhere now and i can have a chance at saving my team. Also i think it would make the game alot more fun in battleroyale if U made it where the storm ends in one of the city's or a cool area on the map, lol like 1 of the small islands üèù. Your jet pack can't fly high enough, the Ninja class can literally get to higher spots then the jet pack. Oh and thats after using my surrounding trying to get to em!?",5
"The only complaints I have are; 1. It takes up a lot of storage space when it needs updating, and I gotta delete all my favorite apps in order to cater for that 2. It takes an hour to download the updates even with great internet connection 3. There's been alot of glitches lately and it causes the game to lag, and it's super frustrating when you're winning and then once it picks up again, the game is over and I've lost. But overall I love this game, it is very addictive and great!",5
"The game itself, one of the best mobile games out there for it's genre. Graphics, controls, response time, ads, etc, all done fairly well for mobile. My issues are there are far too many obvious bots, and their difficulty needs to be raised. like shooting fish in a barrel. There doesn't seem to be enough players using a controller, so i almost never get team mates while using one, since they separate controller players from non-controller players due to fairness. Otherwise, I recommend it.",4
"Since the day I downloaded the game, I used to play it every single day. The recent update is lagging and glitching, every 10 seconds or less it lags, everything disappears and reappears again, even when I tried to lower the graphics quality and frame rate. I'm not sure if this is gonna be read by any of the technical teams, but this problem would really drift us away from playing the game again.",4
"Best multiplayer shooter on mobile by far. The game mechanics are great for a mobile game and the graphics look really good. However the be insane large size of the game takes up so much internal storage. So far the game is over 14 GB and keeps increasing. This shouldn't be an issue for newer devices, but it uses a lot of data. Be careful if u are on an uncapped data plan.",4
"Inexpensive, entertaining, low-risk introduction to world of gaming. Filled with amazing details, customizability and player bonuses. Highly recommended, even for the most staunch pacifist. Infrequent glitches can result in a failed campaign which is frustrating but overall one of the best mobile games ever. Kinda BS when the game randomly deletes your profile and progress including all purchases ü•¥. So that sucked.",3
"Nice shooter on mobile, the controls feels smooth and can be adjust to your liking. Multiplayer mode and Battle Royale is also amazing, so are the weapons as well. To be honest, this game has been great, Until you start to notice the updates, with every update is more heavier than the last. Sometimes these updates comes with more bugs than the previous update. The game is nice, updates are the only issue, won't change rate until this common issue is solved. Until then, it will remain at 3 stars.",3
"Hello, I would like the developer team to focus on some issues happening now in the newer updates. The weapon upgrades has made it more complicated: weapon attachments, levels of weapon, and snipers are bit out of control. And regarding Battle Royale , changes in Map could be more helpful. Sometimes login is giving us some trouble. Kindly look into it. This is really an amazing game. If these issues can be resolved, it would be more interesting to play. Thank you .",4
Hi. I downloaded the new update yesterday and was over the moon to see my phone supporting high graphics. The gameplay was smooth and amazing. To my surprise I logged in today to find out that the settings reverted back to medium and high graphics option is gone! You are requested to please fix this ASAP :( No need now. I upgraded my phone thank you very much!,5
"I'm a cod fan so when Mobile came out, I was ecstatic. The graphics are amazing for a mobile game and the game play is pretty good too on my galaxy s20 ultra. My only problem with the game is all the micro transactions they try to sell you. You pretty much won't get anything worth looking at unless you spend real money and a good amount of it to..",4
"Could be the greatest mobile phone I've ever played if the download wasn't so outrageous. I mean seriously it's still a mobile game after having to use up important valued storage for guns,and skins from a free game is ridiculous. And a game that lags in the ranked battles or on zombies. I'm a pretty decent gamer and the lack of maintenance or actual servers are totally poo. You think lag would be obsolete by now but I guess it's asking to much for the simple things. All in all great game kinda.",3
This game is so amazing it's like black ops 2.0 but black ops is the best but it's so good no adds but I had to get a new phone cause of on my Huawei 6 it's was so laggy so now I got a Google pixel 4a but still lags a bit just a bit it's still good so much weapons and every season is just better and better it also wastes your storage by alot,3
"Good game, I enjoy playing the battle Royale and Alcatraz modes. But if I have to download the gun camos and operator skins I'd already downloaded in the previous seasons one more time, I'll lose it!!!! Please take care of that, and while y'all are at it, fix the network bugs as well.",3
"COOL GAME ! But the only problem is storage . when the storage gets higher the game crashes so I have to reinstall the game to manage my storage . We all have this problem of storage consumption for low and middle end gamers struggle a lot with this problem .Hope codm fixs this. Anyway the game is cool and interesting Thanks, Vis",5
"The game is fabulous. There are various impressing features and types of Weapons are astonishing. Various modes of gameplay are amazing . Some problems are arriving like , Glitch and sometimes Enemy alert doesn't occurs in BR. But else the game is superb......",5
"The game is great and all, but ever since the last update, I experience glitches time and again, but more so i fail to connect to the game because it keeps reconnecting and reloading over and over again and report ""timed out"". I never experienced any of these issues before the recent update. I'm not happy",3
"If u r using wi-fi don't even think about playing this game, even with very strong signal it's glitches and u will just lose your points and will let down the team. In last updates you can be been put together in games with interns or other players have cheat codes etc. U can get many things but can't use them (inventory) My backpack option has never worked and uninstall and install again haven't changed anything. Need improvements for non paying players who played for long time.",3
"I'm so close to leaving this game for good, when I first downloaded COD mobile üì±, it became the most fun and entertaining game I had on my Mobile device but the updates kept on coming, and with that a lot of bugs. Sometimes my melee weapons don't even do damage to my opponents and I hate that because my K/D is falling just because 9f these silly reasons. My Phone Has 6GB ram and it's more than capable of running this game so why does my joystick, aiming and firing button denying my movements",3
"An amazing game,the graphics are marvellous,the avatars are however not so attractive but it's good,the maps are distinctive, weapons are great too! The reason that makes it unique from other games is that it has both mp & br options. Idk why many people dislike it,ig they don't have a good taste. Overall a fab mobile game!",5
This game has been the best time of my life. Played with random players made lot of friends had a lot of fun. But recently the game is not doing so well cause it's getting some bugs and glitches. And some people are hating it and some people are waiting for it to get fixed(I'm also waiting for it to get fixed üòä). I know that the developer's are working hard and doing their best to fix the problems. I really hope that they fix the game ASAP and get the game to its best self. ‚ù§,3
"The game's top, no doubt in this, the only issue u have with it, is that whenever I connect to my wifi it automatically starts downloading every map or resources and it doesn't stop even if I do it manually by using the auto download and ask before downloading option. It doesn't work at all So it will be better to resolve this issue",4
"Can't even get into the game, it keeps freezing on the loading screen, I've been playing this game for over 2 years, And I've never ran into this issue before, Resolve the issue and I will play again.",2
"Everything is good except this one. Downloading speed of resources is between 84 KBPS to 2 MBPS, as I have 300 mbps of constant download and upload speed. It's very irritating because there is almost 10 to 15 GB of data to download with speed of 1 MBPS.... No one can enjoy the game smoothly without downloading these resources...",1
"I have been playing on an off for the better part of 1.5 years, great game really fun looks good. My only complaint even when paying money its so hard to get the legendary or mythic guns witch sucks when your paying real money and still can't get them",4
"It's a great game. It's fun, engaging, and pretty good for when you can't plug in a console to play warzone. However, there was this glitch that happened to me on my old phone as well as this one. The game always randomly sends me back like 12 steps from where I was over and over again. Please fix it.",4
"Dear Activision, kindly Add the feature to delete the Weapon, Operator/Solder, & Vehicle's Skin & Camos. Whatever we don't like can delete permanently to save some extra space due to bigger app size of the COD mobile which increases on each season & Use only those that we like to use in game. Because most of the users don't have high end mobiles & have low storege capacity. The current option to delete camos or skins that I wrote about is not useful because it download again. So kindly add it.",3
I play cod from season 2 . All are perfect but plz add rain and thunder effect in BR . IT gives a perfect look for a game . Othervise good üòä. And another bug my karimbata earned from pump the brakes event is not working that is knife plz fix that.,4
"New update scramble, BR graphics are screwed, when inside house only i can see walls and nothing else only wall. Sensitivity are f*#ked up totally, i have to fix my sensitivity again. i don't know how will i do that very hard to get them back..this game is getting worse and worse with every update. Maybe its time to keep COD on past and join new games_ Apex Legend... or other game.",1
"This is one of the few good mobile shooter games on mobile :) I advise people with low quality wifi or low end devices to watch out because the game may say 2gb storage but it is actually closer to 6gb and sometimes 12gb you get the high resolution resource pack, as well as lots of lag and it is VERY pay to win at times. But overall pretty good üëç",5
"Awesome game! Great graphics, lot of maps and a whole lot of options. Many different types of multiplayer games and different types of BR to choose from. Play alone, with random other players or with friends! Never a dull moment",5
"Some downloads/updates are terrible.. they mess with the gaming experience , like being booted off the game two or more times on the same challenge.. not cool.. Update: 05/30/22 Continue shut downs while playing..needing to start entry allover. Some times can return to match and other times not.",3
"This is a pretty great mobile port, but since I have a Activision account, is it like in warzone where you get skins for owning the other games like Cod war or modern warfare? And it also takes a lot of storage on my phone and is there a way to ask it to not take all my storage? And best of all, the least skilled players can get a few kills as well, and contorller is recommended for more easier controls Thanks for reading!",5
"The game is good haven't had any challenges for the last 3 years until 3 days ago, I can't log in lately, authorisation error every time I try I even uninstall the app, so that I can reinstall again to fix the problem but still giving me the same error message..and by the way the new medikit sucks, return the old one. Please fix the problem ASAP",3
"Awesome game, nothing wrong with it, except that the game takes up too much space & I've done everything to free up space but it just doesn't work. Seriously though, you need a bit over 1 gigabyte of space for just one update? I understand that adding fun things to the game is good, but people who're dealing with a similar problem but wanna play your game, well, if it matters to you to maintain or increase the number of downloads, could we somehow balance the amount of fun & storage plz?",4
Best mobile game I have had on my phone for years but one of my problems is that when you connect thr controller I can't fix the look sensitivity on it but I gave managed to work with it other that I love it good graphics and the people that are in your ranked score area match me very good and it's very even when it come to the fighting and other things to thanks for such an amazing game.,5
Super well done. Been a long time call of duty fan so it's nice to see a well done mobile port. Zombies could use an update and it would be awesome to see some Easter eggs there. I'd hope yo eventually see an experience that was similar to the console zombies play.,5
Game is fantastic! All I have to complain for is that I get black screens sometimes..Although I can hear the game running as normal in the background whilst I'm in a game my screen goes black for some reason..any help?? I'm also interested in battle pass but I would like this to stop first..,4
There are 3 or 4 grenades which is available in battle royale but not in multiplayer. I am requesting that the DEVS put those grenades in multiplayer also. Battle royale mode is hard to control not good graphic. My graphic mode is on highest but it still bad. My v pad is not working sometimes.when you use 4g data you cannot access the game but when you use 3g data you can access the game. Fix this problems. I uninstalled this game.,3
"Was a good game till the team pairing went out the window. I've lost 7 matches in a row because more than half my team are killed more than they kill. And that's every match. That aside, they encourage you to work up the ladder to get rewards, only the lock the good ones unless you pay for a VIP membership. The rewards use to be free and you progressed. But leaving a comment on here, or feedback through the support area doesn't mean anything as they never respond because they could care less.",1
"Just played 2 hrs so i will need to come back with another review. The shooter is nice, good graphic, only pvp. The pvp is split in alot of subcategories. They have alot of weapons ingame and costumes. It's ptw?! Donno. If you pay real money can advance very fast... Updating after a few months. Still enjoying it, you don t have to pay to win, but it will get you nice skins and cammos. I highly recommend this game. Edit. After half year of playing - this is the best mobile shooter.",5
"Ive been having this game for years and its amazing! But there is quite a few problems, for instance bugs and glitches. Other than that its pretty. I really miss the older version, but still amazing.",5
"I have played this game since it's release and it is amazing. The graphics, the available game modes, and the multiplayer action makes the game worthwhile. I highly recommend this game whether you are always on the game or looking for something to play with your friends, competitive or not. Just say thank you to your phone's storage. ;)",5
"Two things really bug me about this. First and foremost, why can't I use a wired controller to play? The input lag from Bluetooth makes for an atrocious gameplay experience, seriously just let me plug my controller in. Second; the menus in this game are hot garbage, why are they so complicated? Navigating a menu shouldn't be a chore. Even though I've unlocked quite a few cosmetics I refrain from equipping them because it's just such a hassle. Other than that, this is an excellent game.",3
"This is probably one of my favorite mobile games as it gives many weapon options to choose from, different modes and challenges, and with every update comes a new surprise although there are bugs here and there but they get them fixed right away just beware of your storage, keep it up Codm üëç",5
"The best multi-player shooting game ever played.. However, I'm editing my review now and give it only 2 stars. The frequency of MASSIVE UPDATES is annoying.. The downloads takes over 4GB every month or two.. The content and updates are super annoying coz u can't start the game without a complete download.",2
An incredibly easy to play game. Fast level ups and tons of customizable guns to find your best play style. A good amount of settings and customization to improvr you gameplay. Just watch out for the toxic players they are everywhere.,4
"I have been playing mobile for a couple of years now and I still don't regret downloading it. Graphics are pretty cool and there's enough players on to be able to jump into a game, so you rarely wait. Make sure you have enough space for it's files, plus a good connection so you don't lag and you're set!",5
"All around excellent fun! I like the challenging aspect of it, and the amount of weapons, characters and upgrades is unreal. Great job development team! Love the awesome sound it makes when you achieve a headshot.",4
"It is the best shooting game. I really enjoy playing this game very much .It got great graphics and so many maps and guns and new seasons every month. The only problem in this game is it's size, I can't download the update of this game, the size it too large.",4
"Great gameplay, but expect to do 2g+ downloads literally every time you open the app, and also redownloading every map after an update, and gun skins, and hd terrain resources, and gun models, and character models, and character model skins, and sprites, and sounds. You can have space on your phone or you can have this game there is never both",3
"I love this game and almost everything about it. However, eventhough I understand that you need to make money from it in some way, the Drawings cost a rediculous amount of money. There should be a way for us to grind for the characters at least, as well as some of the weapons, such as the Samari sword. Other than that, the game is great.",5
Father of all battleground games. Easily understandable controls. Everything is optimised. Otherwise I don't know how big this game is. The total size of it is about 5gb or more. Game graphics and resolution is good. I play in lower graphics as my device's GPU can't handle it. Although a good game doesn't lags.üòä,5
"This game is just amazing. Ive always been a fan of COD on the console, but on your phone amd on the go, it really doesnt disappoint. Ive had no issues so far. Ive signed in once with fb, and have kept my stats since. Theres really nothing bad I can say about it. Edit: No matter what I do, the game ALWAYS crashes. I deleted the cache and restarted it after. I uninstalled updates first, redownload those and uninstalled the game and reinstalled it. Nothing. I made sure I had plenty of space for it",1
"Fantastic Game! I find myself playing this more than any console game that I own. The graphics is spot on, the controls is great, and meet a lot of great people to play with online. All around great experience with Call Of Duty Mobile.",5
"No fun at all. New updates make the game crash every time I play a match. I have a galaxy tablet and just bought a new router hoping to fix the problem. No luck, I hate this app. Always taking up MORE and MORE storage on your device with every update. 2 stars bc its cod.... so much content I have to delete everything else to play",2
"It used to be a fantastic and the best shooter game I've ever played since this last update, now it's just a good game. I have lots of problems during playing like lagging and screen locking during aiming and etc. I just realized you need to keep buying new phones to be able to play without problems, but I can not afford it! I love this game and before this new version I would rate it 5 stars.",4
I did give a 5 star but had to drop it down to a 2 star cause I keep getting kicked completely out of the game back to my home screen on my phone. I've reported the problem and still no fix yet. I've been on this game since the very first battle pass season started. There is one too many hackers to be able to enjoy a good game half the time.,2
"Horrible only because there are so much pay to wins. Also I'm a level 58 version 150s, the game is unfair, there's so much lag. Whenever I try 1v1ing my friends I can't even join it. All it says is ""please reconnect"" this happens only a little bit but its so frustrating. You gotta give me people I can actually verse. Also fix that 1v1 problem. Thank you.",2
"One of the best game I've ever played.. however it becomes very annoying after the season 4 update., Game usually stopped while playing, or sometimes gets slower not until i deleted the updates , and now it's requesting i update it again , i Will try it one more time again if it happens, i will uninstall the game ..",3
Fun game nothing wrong with it would've gave 5 stars but you play the same maps all day. They make u download like 50 maps and you only get the same 4 maps and its not every other game its literally every match ill play and get the same map and game mode 3 times in a row get another map then its back to the same map. Plus when u get to higher ranks you have to wait longer for matches which is ok but I don't want to look at a time reminding me I just wasted 3min waiting on a match,3
Amazing game.. only problem I have is it glitches almost everytime I'm in a match it wants to glitch. Half the time I have to wait to download maps bcuz it take 2 days almost bcuz it's slow at loading. Other than that. It's perfect.. could just be my phone but who nos. ü•∞,5
"I give it 4 stars, great game love to play it controls are good BR is awesome but i only have 2 complaints...... about every match it will lag at least one good time. The other complaint i still cant figure out why i cant get to play zombies. First time i had the game it let me but i just cant seem to figure out what i did to unlock zombies before. Other than that hands down the best mobile game ive ever played",4
This game is awesome but with a few flaws 1. The biggest flaw is weapon balancing:- At the start of each new season we are forced to play only the meta guns because other guns get out played by these guns. 2.Repetitiveness:- At the start this game was so much fun but now it feels repetitive. Lack of new mechanics and exciting modes. In my opinion other than these two flaws this is the second best mobile game out there.,4
"Still crashing, still losing XP, still being banned. Games been crashing a lot, sometimes it doesn't boot. The game itself is great tho. The problem is the crashing and now it had me banned from a ranked match for a bit because ""I had left the game during"" which is false because the app crashed. I don't wanna lose stuff or get banned simply because the app is not working correctly on my device at random.",1
This game is anoying after updating the season 5 with 2gb I had to start the update all over again for no reason I did this about 4-5 times I even deleted and reinstalled it it's still the same I think it's high time I quit CODM... Think more on making the game better and not on how to extort more from the players.,1
"To be honest, there is no mobile game for now that can take this CODM place..it has everything,BR, tournament, even multiple players and dual.. It reconnects after interrupted..I so so so much love this game... But!!! Is so super addictiveüòÇ, lags and the updates are damn scary... doesn't care about how you manage you space,it would consume it",5
"Love it, other than huge updates every month or so a bunch of them requiring you to be in the lobby to do and unable to leave your device idle while they download. Gameplay is suprisingly good, graphics and audio are killer, and I'm not even running the most optimal device.",5
"Tried to download the update 2 times, it restarts after 100% download!! Wth! I loved this game but lately it's lagging a lot! I've a stable internet connection of speed more than 20mbps and still the ping is high as 189-200ms. Lots of bugs and takes up too much space in mobile thus it sometimes feels like the game is not worth the space.",1
"Ranked multiplayer is clearly full of hackers, when a guy can stand still in the middle of the map and instant snap headshot no scope with a sniper with no attachments whilst taking ZERO damage from anyones guns or scorestreaks, then there is obviously something wrong here. Anyone using exploits/cheats/hacks should not allowed in ranked matches and should be monitored better. Ranked BR is not as bad for cheats but they are there. Please look into it.",3
"Update 5/28 Instead of releasing expensive draws every week, this game needs to improve it's Battle Royale mode. There is so much bugs and glitches, it takes the fun and competitiveness out of the game. When landing in hot drops like construction site or rivertown, why does the gun take so long to come in the character hand after picking it up? It seems like for other players, they pick up the gun late and they are ready to shoot while yours is stuck in melee. Huge disadvantage! Not fair.",1
Desync is crazy bad still bit optimization has improved by alot i can play on high graphics now. Ground war and 10v10 need alot of optimization alot of overheating. I alos have a suggestion for saving memory I wish there was an option to just download your and your friends skins only not everything because that's too much.,3
If possible add zombies in Battle Royale and remove that extra load you are giving it by creating separate room for it. It takes a lot of space of mobiles device due to extra maps and new items that are added. Eventually slow game or it freezes at some point.,3
"Playing this game since launch & they still haven't gave us permanent Zombies mode is really disappointing, PC COD's have all the modes but for the Mobile they didn't treat us right! Ngl game is good but without Zombies it feels empty also playing the same modes again & again is really tiring and boring you can easily burn out I'm hoping to quit now since they don't have much to offer!",2
"As an og season 3 player, I absolutely love this game. I have easily 1.5k+ hours on it, but as with any game there are flaws. Persistence, K9 unit, chopper gunner, swarm, vtol, meta weapons and more are all bad for this game, leaving many og players to either quit or hardly play. Although the gamemodes are fun, some limited time modes feel as though they should be permanent. Hard-core is great for grinding camos, but it's lack of appearance is frustrating. And don't get me started on the bugs.",4
"I really like this game. Well done the designers. However.... Occasionally, as other reviews have reported, the screen will suddenly go black, but sound remains. I've also increasingly noticed many players are now using cheat programmes, and despite reporting them, nothing happens. They're running a good game!",3
"On 1 june 2022 , the new update which came , once it reaches to 100% download it stops and nothing happens further. Pls address this problem.... This is the second time this happened today on 2june 2022.......and also while playing game since last season I faced a bug in which when I use joystick üïπ for movement the ads of gun involuntarily moves up in air, it happens with all types of gun iam using from loadouts, mostly in marksmam rifle or sniperss...",2
Awesome game. I love everything about it. But one major request is that can a new BR map be created? Some of us are tired of playing in the same isolated and blackout every season. ex: Do a jungle map or city map.. Something realistic.,5
"Awesome COD game for mobile I do recommend, with warning though. The downside is this game is massive!! It is currently showing 17GB on my phone, make sure you have at least a 128 GB phone or it will take up your storage! Sorry guys got to drop to 4 stars. The hackers are getting bad in game. I try to report, guess it just gets shrugged off! Still happens especially in ranked matches.",4
"Loved it Multiplayer modes and Battle Royale are really cool. Really happy to see new weapons and different maps in Battle Royale . I still face issues like poor Matchmaking in multiplayer mode, sometimes it's like 3 vs 5 which is really annyoing. I am really happy that many bugs are getting fixed in upcoming seasons . ‚ò∫Ô∏è Please do fix the matchmaking process. Thanks",4
"Such a great game. I get to play with coworkers and Facebook friends. I love it!! Maps, weapons, skins are great! I would like to play some of the other maps that I downloaded other seasons but don't get to experience.",4
"I installed the game with a lot of excitement. I have played the pc version, so I was eagerly waiting for the mobile version. But I am stuck in the getting version info page. It consistently reloads itself and everytime it reaches 100%, it starts again. So I am unable to play this game.",2
"Best FPS game available in mobile, graphics are dynamic and realistic. The character movements, guns customizations are best across the platform. CODM still needs to improve, few problems are - - balancing of weapon, e.x. - meta. - Lag and fps drops. - few bugs and glitches needs to be fixed, E.x. - glitch (bug) of current season (wild dogs) sniper scope gets invisible specially of koshaka. It's one of the greatest games in mobile overall It deserves 5 stars. ( best for Users with good device)",5
"I can't see a single opponent and i cant see a single weapon or anything that i can pickup in BR & MP both modes and the game keeps reconnecting without showing ""reconnecting"" on screen and if i am able to see opponents & pickup weapons then my mobile is locked automatically after every 30 seconds,, in short the game is literally unplayable right now",1
I would give it 5 stars except the customer service is really really bad. Others might not have had the experience I had. However my experience was horrible. My issue was passed on to 15 different techs and every day it was an email asking the exact same questions but different people. So they sent me to what they called a special technician and I never corresponded with them so they kept relaying messages from them to me and the. In the end 6weeks later they had me doing basic things that I,2
"STILL‚ù§Ô∏èthis game, but where's helmets & other gear? Plus All Explosives multiplayer & BR. Fix the sector ,crossbow, & thumper aiming and ammunition. I barely play 1vs1, 3vs3, or small squad maps because of the first round where I start as already dead & have to wait to respawn in 2nd round. Uhhg ü§¨. Game smooth also plentiful in goals & tasks. Need small figure 8 board two buildings All explosives,team ,br limited time, super special war machine(S.S.W.M.) üòÉ New undeadsiege less size,more option",3
The game was one of the best I've played up until the game started glitching and freezing. Pisses me off wasting money on something that is broken and needs to be fixed. It only does it in satellite ground war. I can't stress enough how bad this game has gotten...,1
"The game mechanics are not advanced enough to stop someone from either running up on you with ridiculous one hit weapons A PAIR OF BOXING GLOVES! WHICH BY THE WAY WERE INVENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF NOT INJURING SOMEONE or choose the gun that sprays the most in a small area virtually unopposed!!! Fix that please!!!! Also that time delay for people who use ""simple"" is about .5 seconds off so you miss A LOT WITH THE SNIPER/MARKSMAN CLASSES! SERIOUSLY?!",3
"I don't think this game has been made fully compatible with Huwaiei phones. Gaming glitches a lot and graphics are not good. Cannot see what the weapons are when playing, they take the form of brown and green blocks. Also all the characters look like the character when you first start playing the game.",4
"Would be great if all the epic and legendary gear and operators weren't so damn pricey. Even the ones that you can use credits for are expensive, at least the ones that are actually worth anything. But other than that I couldn't be happier with the game, I've been playing it for years now.",5
"The game is good, I've fallen in love, but the fact that an African server is not available is making players like me experience a lot of lags and I can't enjoy the game as much as I want to, I've changed my device settings, changed in-game settings and nothing has changed, an african server would be much appreciated Thanks.",3
"Amazing Game. Fun to play with friends, and the Graphics are so amazing. But, sometimes when I play a match it gets freeze and again it becomes normal. Please fix this issue. Except this the game is perfect.",5
Activision doesn't respond to your feedback. I am unable to login into my account. Everything i try it freezes and I end up giving up and doing smth else.. Detail is stunning guns and skins are unique. All just amazing. Other than that its great.,3
I've downloaded this last update multiple times already and it never completes... just gets stuck at 100% while additional files are downloaded in the background. Then after a while it just cuts off and I have to start again. WHYYYY??!!!,2
"Most complaints have been fixed, the only thing I wish to see come a map from ghosts or mw3. As for the app it's good but a bit large, about 18 gbs, but is good for performance and ui. Edit: most issues with the game has been fixed however, a zombies ROUND BASED MODE would be nice.",5
"The new zombie mode should be deleted or made a separate mode from the original zombies. That needs to be put back. That's the zombies everyone fell in love with. That's the mode that COD hyped up. Thats the one that people miss. Not saying the new zombies is complete trash, but it never has been as fun as the original.",5
"Cons: About 16 Gigabytes of your phones/SD card's space, updates stack on each other I think, literally hve Uninstalled ALL and I really mean ALL apps & had to erase data,& disable so many normal apps like A calculator.. It literally charges u for little Spin chance battlepass or store weapons. Can't change my gamer name 4 sum reason, in the beginning of matches smtimes gun doesn't load &won't appear until 5+min Graphics B-Sounds A-Weapons A+Realism C Compatibility C Pros:üëçgame.. top fps",3
I love this game so much but it glitches a lot . makes it so hard to play sometimes. the hit Marker won't show up or u will stand there shooting and it doesn't do anything. really annoying. other than. when that happens the best game ever !,3
"Good enough. Crying about not being able to use a wired controller when best result is Bluetooth is insane. You should upgrade your phone and play on Wi-Fi. And for others saying controllers are weak ""USE A CONTROLLER"" hahahahahahaha",4
I am furious with the change of modes in ranked mission because no one wishes to play the long matches instead of short games . For example it's blitz round and I hate it to play tag game. I like respawning. Pls don't play strategic games with your customer in forcing them to play long timed games indirectly because you may lose customers like me.,1
"Great game, definitely challenging as one advances to higher ranks. Not for the faint hearted cause it can get super tough. Otherwise 100%, recommend if you are looking for a one way stop to fun and epic gameplay.",5
Best mobile game I've ever played. Had worked flawlessly on my one+6 and now my one+7. Not had any glitches playing for the last few years. Like any games you have to pay for skins etc but you do get lots free. I did pay for the monthly enhanced thing with my play rewards. As long as you pass level 50 you get the next month free. Like the clans and don't mind the monthly large updates as you get me maps and games to keep you interested.,5
"I played cod on PC and I can say that I enjoy this far more than pc. The game itself needs no introductions. But the mobile version is just amazing. I was skeptical at first playing an fps on a phone, but so far I've been impressed. Developers have made this rich with updates and exciting new things. The legend√§res and mythics might take a lot of money and that's the only gripe I have with the game. Addicting, and exciting.",5
"This is one of the best game but after the season 6 .I am not able to play a single match as my device crash , or if my device doesn't crash the game start lagging. So please please please please do something for this issue. I love call of Duty but because of this issue I haven't played any match since a month",4
"I've been playing this game since it first came out and have always enjoyed it. The maps are dope AF, graphics, & overall game play is very addictive. I don't have a console at the moment so all I do is play mobile. I like the game mode updates keeps you on your toes at times.",5
Really nice game until it force closes. It always seems to do this near the end of ranked matches wich cause xp reduction and being banned for ranked for 5 minutes. Draws cause over 100$to get. I've spent $1400 dollars in the past year 1/2 spend your money elsewhere. Half the guns just look cool but aren't worth it,2
"Pls can u guys be the first to make it possible to be able to enable the kindof graphics settings you want,like for instance being able to increase the graphics and turning off ragdolls......because it is not fair that my 6gb ram phone can't be able to go higher than medium graphics setting, and I have seen other 6gb ram that went higher than that, and my phone plays medium very smoothly, so it should atleast be able to play it at high, pls enable more graphics option for other devices ,pls!",4
"the game is fun. interaction with all people of the world, great. but the crashes and kick out freaking is killing me. especially if your in a rank match u get penalized. and no its not ur wifi connection if thats what your thinking. well see how that work with this new season btw be sure to have a lot of storage room.",4
Update: Now being added to an in-progress ranked match doesn't deduct points even if lost is good to have but still being added to an in-progress game real makes my experience frustrating.. especially in search and destroy in which we have to again wait for the round to be completed...,3
Good game üëç look if you looking for a game to play. This is it hands down and I mean all hands down. Best game ever. try it out for you self. Then you see what I mean. Zombies just like the one on the console like PS2 or PS3 or Xbox Xbox one Xbox X1. Good graphics good everything play and you'll find out!!!!!,5
"I've never really been into first person shooter games, mostly because I wasn't very good at them. I thought I'd give C.O.D. Mobile a try just to check out the game play and graphics. For a mobile gaming app it's phenomenal! There is so much content and they keep adding more to. Bravo to the developers, everyone involved with the concepts, making and production of this game, is in my book a true pioneer! ""Go over there and pick up my dog tags!""",5
"This is the best game that I have ever had on my phone,graphics,gameplay and customizable controls gives it a one of a kind gaming experience.The game also consumes alot of space but am happy that it allows us to delete unwanted files and still have some fun playing on devices with low storage.",5
"My favorite mobile game. Currently loving that ground war mode, it's intense! Guys, I have the Tecno Camon 18P and the buttons are unresponsive for a few seconds when i confront an enemy. Sometimes I die because of this. Pls fix",5
Great graphics and good gameplay. But game keeps crashing frequently. Battle Royale crashes like 1 in 3 games. Even on Rog Phone 2 I am playing with low or medium settings. Every update is upwards of 1.5GB. This game hogs storage.,3
This game is so fun. Its online so its not to easy or hard and even if you loose its still fun. I recommend this game to anyone thats interested in cod or shooter games. You can also choose between first person and third person in the battle Royale with i think is really cool as well as TONS of guns im not kidding there's so many.,5
Fix ghost touch on the red magic 7 !! It doesn't let me run sometimes when I'm trying to run and when I'm aiming in and trying to move forward it stops me or moves me back instead or sideways it's soooo annoying and unplayable please fix this issue happening on the red magic 7 ! I have the red magic 7 18gb of ram supernova,2
This game is very Good! The low graphics are good like high graphics but there's one thing I want them to know So the reason I gave this game 4 starts is because framerate and graphic so If you are on a High-End device u have all Of it but low end You wil have medium and Low graphics which high graphics can help you spot enemies do please add high graphics for Low ended device (add max framerate to),4
"Theres a weird lag with the new update... Its probably because youve added the visible bullet streams or something. As it is i had to play on low graphs and stuff now its almost impossible. I do appreciate the game though, hell its the best FPS game ive played thus far. Imma cut you some slack since the 5th season just began... Help us poor low-end device users please ü•∫üôè",3
It has its moments where it would glitch on me. There times where the game was litered with hacks and cheaters but overtime it has improved and gotten better. Plus it's just the best mobile shooter game out there... But unfortunately now in 6/1/2022 the new update won't work on my device... Which will result in me taking away a star and possibly having to try Apex mobile until I can get this problem sorted out.,3
"Hi guys!! I've downloaded this game on my Huawei Y9A. It downloaded fine but when it reaches the part where I'm supposed to enter a nickname and start playing it crashes. I've rebooted the phone and closed all apps, cleared all my ram and tried it again to no avail again. So please advice me on what can do to get it functioning properly. Thank you.",2
One of the best online games for android. The only annoying thing is that sometimes the matchmaking is totally unbalanced (player ranks and levels) and each new season i have to redownload the maps i already had.,4
I have loved this game for so many years but now it seems like this not the game that we fell in love for. There are so many bugs in the game but the developers are upto bringing out some new lucky draws without repairing the major and serious problems in the game.,1
"I've been playing since it was released . Often I get a glitch when approached by enemies, so connection is ruled out . I'm capped at level 150 with little rewards to show for it but I play because I truly enjoy the game and it's helped me through times I needed something to relax and play . The grafics are good & I love battle royale and completely left my legendary PUBG account for it ü§£",4
"It's an amazing game just wish that it wasn't so many gigabytes to download and play it you almost have to have atleast a 4 gigabyte ram for it to run smoothly, and the lucky draws are so expensive they need to be cheaper then 125-150 that's not worth that much but all in all it's a fun game and I give it 3 stars.",3
"USED TO BE GOOD. COD started off as a high graphics good game, great controls and friendly for casual players. now it's getting more pathetic with more tryhards in normal lobbys, more useless ads, more hackers (not getting tracked), terrible match ups and huge bans for no reason.",2
"U know what? I'm getting real tired of this $#!+ ,Activision. I love this game, but I refuse to keep trying to make space just to play it. No matter what device u have, this game is gonna take up more (than what's even necessary for a game) space than any video, pictures, or pretty much anything else on there, and keeps getting larger. And for what? A mediocre BR, and maps that never rotate (Hovec, Raid, Standoff, Firing Range ALWAYS, and MAYBE Terminal once in awhile)? I'll just play APEX now.",1
"Supberb!!! Graphics are nice, gameplay too, very nice game. You can also fix some glitches where I have to restart and reconnect. Other this is a very good game, and lag isnt improving, please fix the server issues. Is there any way to prevent to lag spikes?",4
Owesome game but lag issues during multiplayer. Plus monthly subscription should be more valueable than normal battle pass. To earn CP you need battlepass or required money to buy but to buy all rewards of any new luched weapon lots of CP points required while users must have an option to buy any desired ward at anytime instead of probability mechanism.,4
"Very good, but has bugs with on-target shot registration, matchmaking gets you on bad teams even to the point where one you love wins the match alone, and the optimization of the game is lousy, not to mention how expensive the cod points are, but it's still an excellent game",4
Loving the different modes and weekly joints you guys put in. Weeks later still 5 stars in my book. Add-on. Now I've been playing for years. Still playing 4 or five times a week. Always something new happening. Still love it.,5
"After 2 years of playing call of duty i can say that it was fun for a while but it has lost its epicness with constant lag, frame drops, dysnc and high ping spikes which is why i have changed my star rating form 5 stars to 3 stars, take us back to the good old days where there was no issues",3
"Codm is a good game..Activision am asking for 2 things in BR to be specific..i am a BR player It gets so hard and wild in gold lobbies.when you all drop on the same hot zone and an enemy pics a gun first..clearly its death My suggestion is that you make every player dropping with a pistol,so that we can fight back in a tactical way when an enemy pics an AR first;we can defend ourselves with pistols..lastly make the arsenal loadout drops to be 2 guns paired in one loadout",1
"Why do i have to download 2 or 3 GBs every season? Every gun and skin, every map, sound effect, graphic and ect should be re-downloaded? It takes so much time, recources and mobile data which is not cheap in our country, you konw? Its getting annoying for real.",1
After receiving a configuration download error message numerous times... I have to uninstall and reinstall the game after updates and downloads for my Z Fold 2. Time wasted and data wasted!!! üòî Doing this routine after major changes twice monthly earns this review.,3
Too many storage is consumed......after downloading this game.....you have to update upto 15gb......but it is obvious that the graphics is best.....and you should have a gaming phone or minimum 4gb ram to play it.... however there are lot of option for 5vs5 or 10vs10 matches..... it's amazing....and also have three maps in battle royal......,4
"This game is very good, very grindy when trying to get you guns leveled up. It would be a little more fun if the weapon experience was increased by a little bit. Other than that and the fact there is no way to make cod points in the game itself, it's still very fun and enjoyable.",4
I dig this game! It's pretty good and the graphics are awesome along with the controls are really easy to use. Always can't wait to see what they come up with next for the next seasons. Until then PARTY on Dudes! :),4
"Developer doesn't want to pay attention to improve the quality, adress the glitches, lagging issues. Busy in developing crates, when there is not enough audience, who will buy the fancy stuff. The game not like before its full off issues slowness, crashes, glitches.",1
I love this game but movement stick is buggy it suddenly changes its direction i guess this is called (ghost touch) and the game is just becoming slower...animation time takes more than usual to load even with the lowest settings --- also can you add more features for the gunsmith,3
It's a good game very fun but if you want to try to get any legendary or mythic weapons you have to be rich and the odds of getting one are terrible you have to do all ten draws to get the weapon. And the cod point are stupid expensive is definitely pay to play if you want to get anywhere.,3
"Really bad experience, the matchmaking is not fair in ranked matches, teammates leave often but our ranks are decreased even more, the matchmaking is absolutely not fair, it should be skill based. It gets irritating as it happens to often, there is also alot of lag and we can't play properly.",2
"Problem is with updates, there are some daily updates the game does and does not give you an option to cancel, also when a new season starts, the game just stacks more memory on your phone instead of replacing stuff that is no longer in use, some of the stuff takes the fun out of yhe game like tht thing tht alows people to jump around",3
"Great game, graphics and gameplay are close to that of console games. Well made for a Mobile game, the gun upgrading system needs work. I own Vanguard, cold war, warzone, black ops 1,2 and 3. With that being said its a good overall game",4
"The matching mechanism needs improvment. Almost each game is one-sided, won or lost with more than 100 kills difference. One team is as good as pro, and the other is as dump as robots. One team has all kinds of choppers and bombers, and the other has only hand weapons.",4
I like it but half the time it kicks me out. If I play 1 game kicks me out. And it's lagging half the time. But this game is great. The thing is the fast ttk guns ruins the game. Like if I want to use for example I want to use the gks while the other team is with Mac 10's,4
"It's very cool, the graphics, customisable controllers, optional gameplay and many other features..... You only need to have the skills to play and it will be a very enjoyable experience for you",5
With all the cheaters I get banned for just logging into blue-chips...not right. Didn't know there was a rule against playing it on the computer. All I did was log in. No cheat codes or whatever. I spent money on a season pass and you took it from me. I just spent it. I want my money back. The season had just started and I feel I was overly punished on this.,1
Update: they fixed the game bug so no more getting kicked off. I love cod mobile. The only thing I don't like is the fact that you have to spend 200 dollars on an epic character. Update: the new update for cod mobile is bad. It has slowed the game down i keep getting kicked off the games.i love call of duty and have to say that this game is probably the best fps I've played for the mobile.,5
"Great game, would give five if it wasn't for couple minor issues. Direction control disappears from screen. Also get score streak screen pop up over game screen, causing no response from controls. Shame overall its outstanding mobile game. I originally posted this review in 2021. Still have the same glitches and more. Opponents moving quicker,shooting faster and getting shot by invisible opponents. Seems to be more you spend better you are.",1
"The game is really nice, and Is love to give it 5 üåü...the reason am not giving it five star is the fact that it really takes alot of time while loading the startup screen, sometimes upto 5 minutes, and the next thing, i think you should add a button to delete any unused files, coz now my game is over 25GB... anyways the game is epicü§ûü§û",4
"The game is not running on Wi-Fi. On the loading screen it says that download configuration failed and to check the network connection and try again, even though the Wi-Fi connection is working properly on the phone in all other apps.",4
"Game is good and graphics are excellent üëåüëå But there is a problem it takes so much data for starting every time. But the gameplay is fantastic üòçüòçüòçüòç Really Love the game. Therefore, I will give it 5 star rating.",5
"This game is amazing although there are some things that can be improved for example can you make the thermal Scopes more realistic, and you could also add ads to akimbo like in combat master, and please add thermal Scopes to gunsmith customization, last please add overkill perk other than that it's the best keep it up",5
"Do not spend any money in the game! Your account will be repeatedly lost! Make sure you have a new phone and 5G, or else you'll never really compete at the higher levels. No need to spend a cent to have fun, but it gets frustrating when you can't press the right area of your screen to achieve the desired result. Without a controller get ready to watch your character get killed a lot as it struggles to enter windows/obstacles, get in/out of vehicles, etc.",5
"Though controls may be different then what most people (console and pc users) are used to, they are easy to figure out the game is very fun and is filled with gamemodes and cool things like the tempest scorestreak. They should add stuff like this to warzone. Super great game especially when you go on rampages with an 100 round LMG. Highly recommend. P.S use as val or mk peacekeeper. Outlaw sniper rifle good",4
I am only giving 3 stars based on current ablity to play. App continues to restart to Activision screen when trying to log in using Call of Duty log in button. Guest and Facebook log in works fine??? I have game on 2 phones and it does it on both phones‚Ä¶ Have deleted n download game 2 times since this started happening,3
It takes a WHILE to install but it looks great for a moblie game if not the best a lot of weapons but a very pay to win game but a dosen of people can spawn behind you when you are in a fire fight i have installed it a diffent device and it take up a lot of storage but i never have problems with mobile game besides fps drop but it has has alot of things to do battle royale is fun you have to purchase a pack for zombies but it have very smooth controls for a mobile game its better than 75% of cod,3
"With current recent adjustments and updates, & balance changes, including the much needed ""persi"" Nerf... The game is going back to being fun to play again. Although they still need to look into the stupid lags and desync. But all in all its better now!!",3
"Giving 1 star because of its size and continously crashing while playing ,the worst thing about this game is it always asks to download the same skins operators and maps ,this makes me irritate so much and sometimes lags in battle royale while real players are infront of me,it makes me difficult to target them..üò°üò° So please fix this. Moreover it is much better than pubg and free fire ü§°ü§°",1
A great game but still needs a lot of development regarding glitches and also sometime it lags when an enemy is near you . Also there is a match making issue it sometimes matches you to world class players even you are in grand master and also sends bots to your team but the opponents team is having good players and this happens most of the time cod please see this it's serious for most of the players,4
"Hands down vest mobile game experience ever, multi-player runs amazing maybe few adjustments here and there with the controller addition but, I'm mostly here to complain about why there's a download for the zombies game mode but there is no zombies game mode. Please add back.",5
"I keep getting banned. I play on 4 different accounts. Each one is banned because i play well. I can understand, playing too well makes you look like your hacking, but how can you account for people playing with controllers on the game. Truly unfair. At the same time, if a player doesnt play well and dies alot, us good players shouldn't be punished for being better at the game.",1
"Best mobile game in existence, hands down, I play this every single day, you've got to have good memory and stable internet for the best experience, controls are easy to get used to and content is always updating and changing (never gets boring, but also means needs tons of regular downloads)",5
This game is amazing; the graphics is very nice and the controls standard is appreciable .but there is a small problem with the charcters.the characters are like fully armored and like robots actually but if they are like humans i have no complaints about this game.and in battle royale there is only one map available they should go with several maps then players can enjoy the game.most recommended game,5
"The best mobile game of all time. Congrats üëç. Update 24-09-2021 They changed the colors of the grass, land and items very difficult to identify the player on the land because the colors contrast is very big and not realistic. I used to play Battle Royal but not any more ... I just hope my comment will give them thinking about this big issue. Cheers Luckily that they haven't changed battle royale clasic.",5
The game is super cool but the thing is that. It takes a long time to load the the game even with the fast internet connection it's so. Fastraitg and you can get banned from the match if. Something goes wrong with.Your internet SOOOOO ANGRY üò† üò° üëø üò§ üòë üòí üò†!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUT IT'S STILL COOL,5
The game is extremely good to play with. The graphics are awesome and getting better. But sometimes the ms goes up and the game starts from the same spot over and over. I think this problem should be looked into and handled.,5
"Amazing fun multiplayer experience, zombies mode is pretty lackluster and has bugs, battle Royale keeps you on the edge and a lot of free content to be had. Also draws suck, don't waste your money unless you're willing to potentially pay a LOT for a dumb effect.",3
"Great game. Suggestions: Remove bots from the game. Have an option to select difficulty level for battle royale etc. like in other PC games like NFS, Hitman. Reduce too much sliding & jumping tactics (it's annoying)",5
The game is great but what people are saying about the COD Points is 100% true. The lucky draws are 100% designed to make you spend more and more money. There's a reason less than 1% of the people who play the game are rolling with lucky draw skins and the cost of CP and the quantities in which you can purchase them are ridiculous. You can't just purchase the exact amount for a season either. You've either gotta spend $15 for a combination of 2 packages or $25 for more CP than you need.,3
"Good game, but I have other apps on my phone, it requires so much space, 1.68 GB for the season 5 update, too much pay to win, if it wants me to update, fix bugs, and stop with the phone control, Activision really thinks this will be the only app on the phone, honestly not worth it if you have a life",3
"Downloaded new version twice now, and it freezes at 100% downloaded. So at this point, it has used up over 3gb of my data. I still have yet to have a chance to play the new version. Do to download problems.",1
Awesome graphics many options for the best experience. Realistic gameplay and the GUNS they r just unbelievable. And the flying jacket is awesome everything is awesome and number of modes and maps in multiplayer is super.,5
"This game is very good and this game but it needs to download the maps and the size of the maps are very huge, and after download the game size become from 2 GB to 15 GB. And I can't understand that why this game needs to much data resources to play this game. I've other games and they don't take too much phone storage like it. Due to have huge size sometimes it laggy and other games also affected due to it.",4
"This is a good game. It has good controlls, and amazing quality I do recommend. And it is amazingly fun. Also great weapons I can get lots of kills with them. Its worth playing. There is updates for new experiences and new things to play with, and use. If you or or your friend or friends are trying to find an amazing multiplayer game or even a great online game this is the game for you or your friends. There is cool stuff to unlock like skins, and guns. Although I do only recommend 13+. :)",5
"After new update, gameplay is worse than ever. Not at all able to play swiftly. Even though it takes 11 GB of your storage it doesn't give justice with plays. Highly disappointed and frustrated feeling!",1
"Not sure entirely how, but my account got secured and no one else has been on it but me for a while now, so I'm comfortable with changing this to a 4 star review. I do see other people are still dealing with the same issue I had, so play at your own risk with that knowledge.",4
"I think the game is great! I play many battle royal games and this one's one of the best I've ever seen! Though it has the bug that everyone's talking about. I love the graphics! I hope new good updates come! I really hope you fix the bug, Everyone wants that! Hope you add more great things to the game! :-) :-)",4
"This game has cost me a lot of data for both failed download updates, maps and other resources. It sucks sometimes. Above all, codm is a top notch. Kudos to the developers. Most addictive game.",3
"The game can be fun, when you're queued into a match with people trying to have fun. Unfortunately, the ratio of tryhards and people playing just to be annoying compared to people actually trying to have fun in astronomical. This is not helped by the fact that weapon balancing is an absolute nightmare (see the mac10, a weapon that can ADS and kill before most other weapons can even ADS). If a few of the weapons could receive at least minor nerfs, that would help make playing much more fun.",3
"Its very good ,but I have 2 problems, to start the downlaoding of maps, weapon skins and other downlaodable game internals are alot which annoyed me and the other thing is that the battle royale game mode is not that good but on the other hand the modes like gungame,ffa,team death match are the best in this game.Over all the game is from my favourite games ,please Activision try improving the game more and more and avoid these disadvantages.üôÇ",4
"Still a cool slick little game to play when bored/20-30+ minutes or so for that COD fix. Apex is great but this is still good. Want to play Cod, but dont have a console / have a life now / didn't like extra micros in over $70 usd game? Well you now can play guilt free! Heavily Suggest you game on good to perfect Wi-Fi / great data locations. Controls ok. Can buy 1 season pass and get all future passes, if you hve discipline and dont spend your premium Gold currency between seasons.",5
"Big fan of this game since its released.the creative ideas of the game will inspire others games as well.but after a update of 2 or 3 seasons the game became very laggy, especially after the season 8.every time i play Codm during a squad fight the game goes freezed for 2 or 3 seconds.fps of the gameplay getting poor.Cod Mobile should make free characters,camo,skins to time limited to reduce the overall resource size of the game.optimise the game as much as possible especially in BR.",5
Graphics and gameplay are great but the team balance is always way off. Once you level up you end up spending your time fighting aim asist and hackers. They are not doing anything to police cheaters so anything you spend on the game is a waste.,2
"It was fun for a bit, however it has a bug that logs me out every 30 seconds in the middle of a match killing whatever I'm doing and keeps reoccurring so often I can't even play a match, I'll play again when this bug is patched",3
"It's a fun game, but everything is way too expensive. The support system isn't great because they take hours and sometimes days to respond to each message. I bought cod points and didn't recieve them and it took a week and a half of talking to the support agent to fix the problem. I met one helpful support agent that actually seemed like he cared and he got my problem fixed as fast as possible. (Thank you Debeesh)",3
Overall this game is AMAZING (besides all the sweats) but I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 because of the massive amount of storage the updates take but I understand the the game needs a lot of storage to run well ut other than that the game is AWSOME!!!,4
"Absolutely love the game, one of the best mobile games i ever played. I love how you can level up quickly and easily get cool skins and new attachments for your guns. I have never lost a single battle royal gane and thats all i play. There is just one massive problem with the game tho, the MEMORY i play the game for a month then delete it from having to much memory taken up then i come back a year later to have fun and play this fun game again only to find out that it takes up 10 GIGA BYTES.",1
Please make Undead Siege permanent for those of us who want to chase the camos and still enjoy playing the game mode. I've just logged on to chase the last 7 camos I need for the calling card and the update has removed the game mode completely. Very frustrating,1
"I gave a star because the first one is very much in the bot game. This is very annoying. Secondly, every time a new update comes, the volume is high and then all the maps must be downloaded from the beginning. These conditionsüôèüí™",1
"Doesn't crash as much anymore, it's a decent game, standard MP is actually fun as the sweats are in ranked, as they should be, controls are good for mobile, maps are good, except Shoothouse, BR is actually fun, and the Zombies mode is good, microtransactions are, for the most part, purely cosmetic. All in all 7/10",3
This game is good but only reason I gave it five star is that every time I need to update I have to re-download cause it takes up so much space they need to work o. That literally the only game I have cause the every update takes up more and they don't really add that much to things everyupdat at least make it worth the update with different weapons etc after update,3
Great game never have had a problem I don't like the fact that it is not available offline but other than that probably one of my all time favorite mobile game ever pretty close to the original call of duty but there is more gun options but overall great game I would 100 percent recommend this game if you like any shooting games.,5
Something is wrong with rank mp. It starts up normally but as soon as I enter the game I'm alone which is weird because 4 others players included myself voted for a map. Regular mp is fine its just rank for some reason. I'm gonna do 1 star just so I can hopefully get it noticed other than that great game,1
"The gameplay is amazing, however there are some major cons. The game is HUGE. It's currently taking up 14MB and I cannot download anything else. If this game has another update to make it any bigger, then it will need to be deleted. Everything is ridiculously overpriced in the game. And so so often it will not let you load into a match. It's ridiculous. 3 stars for the awesome gameplay, but literally everything else is a con.",3
"The contant updates makes the game so laggy that it's basically unplayable unless you are using a high end device. Not to mention the ping issue. SA does not have a server then they match these players with 100ms againt other players plaing on 20ms, resulting in match losses time after time. It's absolutely impossible to enjoy the game with these issues and it doesn't seem to get fixed.",2
"Honestly this is really fine game. Yes there are pop ups for micro transactions but the game itself is really great all around. Lots of different game modes, I love the battle royale and the classic multiplayer. Haven't tried the zombies yet. Props to Activision because this is probably the most immersive game I've played on a phone yet. Bravo",5
"So finally it forced me to delete the game. I have internet with full speed and even after that whenever I open the game it just shows loading and then a notice pops-up showing ""please check if your device is connected to the internet"" even after having internet on, with full speed. I restarted the phone but nothing really happened. I forced stop the game but nothing happened. This is happening with me since the last update.",1
"The game is really good , matchmaking is quick and leveling up is also fun and engaging. Playing in my device which is POCO X3(8GB ram and Snapdragon 732G) (in low graphics & max fps settings) it lags a lot after sometime. While I get a decent performance in multiplayer mode..but the framerate performance suffers a lot in battle royale modes (dips to 20fps and below) specially when there are enemies nearby and its not at all smooth ...Please optimize it properly and reduce the resources sizes.",3
"So I wanted to get the hd version but I had to delete alot of photos I can't get back, it deleted a bunch of my apps too without me even knowing especially my lyrics and poems because I write music to cope with my mental health and now it's all gone. Over 75 songs and poems. gone. I redownload the app to find out they don't save when you delete the app (heading there next) I have more to say but complaints are limited. overall I demand satisfaction! I want my writing back! I don't deserve this!",2
"I'm only giving 3 stars because this used to be my favorite game. If that weren't the case, I'd only give 1. The newest update for season 9... The graphics are awesome. The gunsmith idea, in theory is great, in practice not so much. The guns I have equipped with sights, don't have sights on during game play. The recoil on the weapons is atrocious. I empty 2 clips without killing an opponent and end up dying myself. Updated to change to one star because of the amount of cheaters they allow.",1
"They destroyed the game. I went from being on of the best in the world to not being able to finish a match. Expect modders in your lobby, also they drop controller users in with you and that makes it basically impossible to win. Ranking does not matter anymore. If you don't know how to play and get 2 kills or jump around looking at walls blocking people's shots just quit.",1
I like the game but randomly in battle royal the ge will like freeze when I'm shooting for like 10 seconds and that makes me stop shooting and j end up dead because I also stop moving. This is my only problem pthrr than that it's a good game.,3
The game is fantastic however it asks update redundantly . Do not ask Us to update the game and also other necessities inside of the game (accessories). once we updated that is it. It takes too much time to download as well as to open the game.,2
"Very good overall. There are few glitches and the aim assist is kinda broken at times, but I like it and it's very entertaining. Letting f2p players earn gold coins would be nice, but that's not a requirement",5
"My gun doesn't work all the time. For some reason, it is selecting when to respond. I use an inbuilt trigger on a Xiaomi BlackShark 4 and the game was running perfectly prior to this update. I can't play again without a fix",1
Really good thoroughly enjoy this game. One of the best fps games on mobile. Very good free to play as well. Absolutely recommend anyone to try. Only issue is size of game and size of updates everytime it has to redownload so much. Really frustrating having to redownload skins and maps and shite every update!! Why?? The only game on mobile I have played that does this.,4
Activision seriously need to look into this I've wasted up to 2Gb data already on trying to update the app. Only to find out that the 4Gb space left on my phone memory prior to the update mysteriously vanished while downloading additional resources and as a result the update couldn't get completed. You shouldn't have said it is 1.4Gb when in fact it is 1.53Gb size. Why do I have to download the additional files too before installing the update? I am sad and seriously regretting trying to update,1
It's great Apex and EA did a great job couldn't expect less. It's so cool how you can connect with people and the type of rewards you get even though it cost money you could play this with just the rewards they give i prefer older version but the upgrades are also super cool how it's getting better and better,5
"Great game all in all, genuinely enjoyable.runs smoothly and I've encountered almost zero bugs.Matchmaking can be a little frustrating at times since some players sweat more in casual than ranked, but i would recommend CoD Mobile to anyone with a taste for shooters.",5
"Be aware of updates. At first it shows 2.2 gb update size then it reduces to 1.4 but when u download it, at first it will show its progress normally but when it reaches 100 percent it just draws more and more data like full 2.2 gb of data is costed this way. They are scammers.",1
Gameplay is great. My problem is that I literally get booted every game as of late and have to load everything back up and reconnect to the game. I would like this bug to be patched please,2
"This game was good at first, but keeps getting worst with issues after issues. This most recent upgrade with the new season messed up big time. I tried logging in and it keeps bugging out and timing out.",1
Was a game I played quite a bit. Now all it does is freeze up when I get to the last screen before the game. Uninstalled and downloaded again. Not only did it not work but I lost everything. Sucks!!!! Will not play again,1
"Lots of bots make me feel OP. w/e, good practice. 2 star review is because neither one of my 2 designated mobile controllers work. MOGA mpx5 or something I bought to use with my tab s7. Even though it's BT, game still won't detect. And then Razer Kishi which is legit designed for phone gaming, I guess because it is a weird connection?... disappointing",2
"Love the game but I uninstalled it a while back. Decided to download it again and my game won't work with my PS4 controller. I cant move or look. I thought if I changed it from PS4 to another controller setting it would fix but it still messed up. Five stars of this wasn't an issue but for now, 3 stars it shall be",3
"Every time there is an update, I have to download every resource pack and map.Horrible hip fire accuracy for close targets. Not a good experience to enjoy a game.",1
"After download it says Download Configuration Failed and make sure that device is connected to network. Device is well connected to network via WiFi. What should I do? Tried troubleshoot like Clear Cache, Device Restart. Not working Somehow I managed to enter the game and now the problem I am facing is I am not able to do login most of the times, it says Check you Network Connection where I am having 40Mbps connection. What to do?",1
App crashing now!! Tue May 31st Samsung Galaxy s21 Boost Mobile. App crashes after downloading the required season 5 update. It is trying to auto sign in threw facebook but code freezes it somehow. Music plays then app crashes. 25 minutes it's been doing this since getting home from work and updating wanting to play. Might delete again and this time never reinstall.,1
Fixed the freezing. Works well now. 4/22 Just changed my review. From 5 to 2. It freezes way more in Battle Royale now. More then ever before. Hope they fix it with the new update. I'm talkkng freezing sometimes twice a game. I have to turn my Tab S6 on and off. To hope I rejoin the game without getting killed.,4
"I love the game, as long as nothing goes wrong. Twice I have had to go to customer support and both times they have been as useful as a chocolate teapot! They are unhelpful and write there useless replies like they have done something helpful. If I could add pictures of the screenshot of horrendous messages to this I would. I genuinely think the game is 10 out of 5 but the service -10 out of 5. Such a shame, if it doesn't change I'll have to uninstall as there is no other way they will learn.",1
"Great game but I'm an average player in Battle Royale and it's no fun when you progress through the levels and end up with all the pros killing you every single game haha. Could be more enjoyable if matched with players more my level for at least some of the time. Can't build my skills if I don't even get a chance to fight, because I'm instantly killed by a pro player haha. Edit: ok the game is much better all round in May 2022. Smoother game play and matched more equally to skill level now",3
Excellent game but the graphics and updates and downloads take too much space and uses too much memory for a phone. You struggle to stay in the game if your phone and Internet connection is not top of the range making it difficult to compete. It keeps on downloading even if I choose the option to ask before downloading. My space is running out.,3
Great game with smooth gameplay and good graphics for a mobile game. It has a simple gun menu wich leads to cool customisation with close resemblance to warzone or modern warfare BUT battle royale is too easy and boring and multiplayer is just so much better,5
"This game improve a lot, from starting to till now , I uninstalled it few times because of bugs and glitches but it works far better, thanks to cod team giving smooth gameplay experience. Graphics are too good.",5
"Hi codm team, I've been facing this issue for a month, whenever I start the game it stuck at getting version info. at 99%. And doesn't start the game. I have to clear storage everytime to start the game. Please help.",3
Game is not logging in or not even asking to login. Previously it used to do it automatically. Like Single Sign On. Game page stays idle without loading anything. This is observed more in latest update.,1
"Fun to play! But even with temporary invincibility when you spawn players manage to instantly kill you with kill streaks and then roll non stop vtols, chopper gunners, stealth chopper, napalm strikes, ect so you cant get out of the spawn on ground war to even cap a point which fine is because a special cap point opens up couple minutes in which the other team caps with ease and the game is over! everyone is sitting wondering how someone got the points to rolled all of that 30 sec in game!",5
Nostalgia took me to this game as I always loved the early CODs. Was really pleasantly surprised with how it plays and the amount of old multiplayer maps that I used to love. Battle royale mode is also terrific and a worthy rival to Fortnite etc. Keep the updates coming with new maps please!!!!,4
"The gameplay is flawless most of the times, except when you face hundreds of annoying (but not deal-breaking and sometimes quite creative) bugs. The most nerve-cracking aspect of this game, is the updating. You have to download EVERY SINGLE THING, EVERY SINGLE TIME, EVERYTIME an update is released! All the maps, all the characters and all the weapons. Again and again and again!",4
"Its great, the graphics, the sound effects and everything, but the bots, in ranked, they are so annoying, like sometimes im the only non-bot in the team and we get beaten easily. Other thing, they should add one or two free legendary weapons.",4
"Love this game not far off from the console versions great graphics too! Great job activison! Only problem ive bin having is syncing my bluetooth xbox, ps4, gaming controllers to the game to play from time to time.",5
"For the past few weeks I've noticed a significant difficulty change in BR and Ranked Multilayer modes. Normally either winning, or finishing strong, now myself and other players I team up with are rarely able to kill one or maybe two enemies. As of the latest update; 6 games of BR and the ring of death is faster than your cars, you are ALWAYS engaged by at least 2 teams of 3 or 4. Game has gone from challenging and fun to pointless in one update.",1
"Best Mobile multiplayer game if you like FPP Great graphics it will be so much better even if you play in low graphics, Lots of Map and Guns skins smooth gameplay no lag at all The only thing that bother me is battle royal is not that better. just make it like multiplayer ( I mean the charector movement and guns damage etc.)",4
"This Game is fairly alright,the only problem is the matchmaking system that has to be fixed a little,it's very discouraging when u play with people who are in legendary rank and your in elite!üòí,but everything else about the game is oküëåüèæ from the graphics to the skins and variety of guns",4
"Usually have a great time with this game, but since the update I can't even start it up. It freezes after the log in screen and even though I've rebooted and reinstalled it, it won't work",1
Great game but the constant updates is ridiculously extreme. If I didn't have unlimited data there is no way I could even manage them at 1 gig or more each update usually every other day. Not to mention add on price for things is extremely overpriced. PC game emulators will let u annihilate phone users as ur frames and input will be immensely higher and faster then a mobile device.,3
Brilliant game. Good graphics and really no need to spend money making it a fair system. To be honest I've largely stayed with the weaponry I started out with except for perk's etc. Best shooter I've found so far.,5
"I absolutely love this game. I used to play this game when I was younger. And now you can play where ever is absolutely awesome. I love playing this game. But when I play matches it doesn't show the operators from other players so everyone looks like the beginner skin. I don't know if that happens with everyone but, please fix it. Other than that it is a pretty good game.",5
Awesomeüëçüëçüëç This game can be very addicting ithas great graphics and loadout choices multiple game types and overall is just awesome fun... Sony is hosting a competition soon hope to be in it. I have had a few issues with glitching here and there but overall I would say that it's due to wifi or the device I'm using may have a lower end processor. Use a good wifi connection and a decent device and you shouldn't have any issues. Fully customizable controls as well big plus. Have a blessed one.,5
"The only game I still haven't uninstalled and probably never will. This game is amazing! I have a PS4 and I never play it because call of duty mobile is my preference. Great graphics, great controls, great everything. Highly recommend it",5
"It's now almost 3 years in, and it has gotten a bit better. The armor plates help, gives fairer play. Now it's really skill base. BR is awesome, mp can use some work, but you are up against more humans which is great. With some more tweaks it will be an epic game. Lovin' watching it grow and transform into something great.",4
"UPDATE: This game used to be good, but now there is just so many pop ups and downloads it's getting on my nerves. Borderline unplayable sometimes. game, annoying amount of downloading and space taking. This is an amazing game, I just feel like they should make us do less downloading, I have had to download and update this game so much its getting annoying. To the point where it's not playable!! I have to download the maps. Download the camos. The HD textures, etc.",3
Call of Duty MOBILE is awesome... Flat out its hands down the best game on Google play store. Anyone can pick up and play hands down the most options available in game from the full settings menu to all the different guns and parts in shityoucan put on them. Players and maps are A+,5
This game is cheaters and hackers haven. No action taken when you report. Currently has a lot of lag. Screen freezes everytime you meet with opponent players. Currently every time I'm in a dangerous position my screen hangs. Sometimes I think its deliberately done to knock me out of the game. Using skills against playing players is not effective or never works. One star for graphics.,1
"I am very sad to say that I am quitting the game. The reason is severe lag, and ping spikes. I cannot enjoy the game anymore. FPS drop just kept getting worse as the seasons progress. Until this major issue of lag is fixed, I am quitting the game. :(",3
"I absolutely loved the call of duty games starting from world at war and ending with MW (2019). I love how they took the best things from all games and put them together perfectly. I spend hours a day playing this and the only complaint I have is the battle Royale mode, enemy's appear out of nowhere in front of you making snipers pointless and making the experience go from yay to meh. Everything else is perfect in my opinion. (So good that I reset my account so I can earn Damascus again)",4
"It's so addicting. but the matchmaking... ITS IS SO HORRIBLE. First off, it sucks having to carry your team just to lose but the stupidest stuff. I swear my team is always bots and the opposing team are just so much better than me. I play to get better, not to lose to op people while MY WHOLE TEAM (accept for me) HAS AN AVERAGE OF 10K A GAME COMBINED?!?!üò†üò† There r so many f2p players and I am one of them, and I find it very difficult to get really good skins and ect. Plz helps us f2p playersü•∫",3
"Kinda stupid how you can que up with people that are using controller if you are just using touch controls since they have such a major advantage, so i think they should split the ques. Other than that it is a pretty good game",3
The game was showing update notification in the starting and I have updated it twice of 1.53GB but it's not updating. It's showing the same update notification when I start the game. Seriously it's really bad stuff from the only game which I like so much. If it's update isn't officially out yet in my country then why it's asking to update so early. So please tell me what would say about this?,1
"After 2 years and many updates, Voice chats has a big bug which makes player close the game and restart it to fix everytime we face the problem. As a flagship phone owner i have so many lags and it shows how game isn't optimized on specific devices.",3
"Update has screwed up gameplay, it's near on impossible to play. Fire button does not work or is temperamental. Game is unplayable and everyone is having this issue, I'll stick to pubg til you short this out. Surely this should have had to be tested before you released the update!!!",1
"You developers ruined the look of gold camo skins for all the guns, it doesn't even look like gold it looks like yellow sand. The graphics are now trash looks horrid. Can't play properly so many bugs. Last update was better and playable and it was fun.",1
"Man loved the graphics and gameplay. Just add some more things to the maps , it would be better if you add some ""Mission"" focused games and bigger maps. Loved the game.",5
The game is fun and all but the only thing I dislike about this game is I crash. It gets annoying that it crashes after some matches or as soon as I get in a game it freezes and kicks me out the game this needs to be fixedüòû,3
"Even after sitting next to wifi which has speed of 30 Mbps, the ping would rise near 200 for few seconds-Need to improve. Need new levels past 150 in the profile. Need new mods/attachments to increase damage. Cost of acquiring legendary weapons should be lowered. Its damn expensive and the probability to acquire the gun in the draw should not be on the last chance",3
Every time I manage to score a mythic weapon the game closes and I have to start again. It gives me the option to reconnect to the game when I reload the app but by then I'm already dead. Seem when I'm in a position to win the game quits every single time. I can't be the only person experiencing this..if it keeps happening Im going to leave areveiw every single time it happens. Idk what else to do.,4
"The team is hands on: always updating it every month with new maps, missions and cool rewards. So far it's taken 16 GB of space. A small price to pay for a cool idea.",5
"I think the grafics of the game is amazing I never have problems with it, I think that they should often give CP but only once each week. I think maybe if you do that maybe you will get more people playing.",5
"Great action. Love the game. Only problem is that my acct has disappeared. I was at master 111 and had no choice but to start all over again. I was able to add that acct as a friend but nothing else Sucks that no one will talk to you...a dialoge would be nice. I've spent money...lots, now everything that was purchased i no longer have. Money thrown away. I am terrible at the computer. That is some why people need a 1:1 to resolve issue If this was resolved i would change my rating & comment.",2
"The game is good, but ever since the update, I've been experiencing very frequent crashing. Unsure if it's a bug, but please fix. Other than that, I haven't ran into any other problems.",5
"Great!, BUT these updates!!! They are to big, user's must have a top range device to play well, i was ok with 4g ram, this latest season has TOTALLY RUINED my experience, delete all other apps and move anything and everything to external storage and STILL its so LAGGY and GLITCHY its unplayable now, you need to FIX the deletion of some downloads, i delete all MP maps , as soon as i re open the game there back!",3
"Great to have this game! My Xbox broke and I can't play modern warfare, but this game just does great I appreciate it. The game is overall good and can't wait to see what updates bring on soon. Hopefully we can get better graphics coming in soon and smoother frame rates!",5
Its crashing. I can play game but only the matches work not BR. The game is full of keyboard users cheats and modders. The chests never give good gear. The random is never random. I played 5 times and got 4 of the same map. The chat room is full of pple wanting it to be tinder and wanting to hook up instead of play. The new season is horrible.. 2022 update Game sucks. Cant log on to my orginal account. I keep having to install and uninstall to play the game. The hackers are worse.,1
It's a good game but they keep taking stuff away such as ground war and shipment 24/7. Once they have a map and area everyone likes they take it away and it's not as fun. If they bring those places back I'd rate it much higher,2
"Great. Game play is real close to console play. Also enjoy leveling up my weapons and unlocking camos. Would like to see more classic weapons (P90's, Colt 45's, etc), more classic maps, and more akimbo options.",4
This game was very good but now it's lagging too much. They are increasing there space. It seems that one day not a single mobile can support it and may be it's space will cross 10000 GB . Activision is not doing anything for this . I think people will be no longer able to play in mobile. This game's name will change from CALL OF DUTY : MOBILE to CALL OF DUTY : PC . This is one of the reasons why players are leaving CODM.,3
This game has improved A LOT. Though they took a outbreak type of zombies mode approach and they managed to make it sort of fun. The weapon meta is REALLY good and feels pretty good and the skin designs for weapons and characters looks very good! But I feel like there is more modern weapons than futuristic and much older weapons like World War 2 guns. If Console and PC got a Call of Duty that's very similar to Call of Duty Online or this game then I reckon it will be very successful.,5
"Been playing this game since its launch, has been amazing to play until just recently the game has started lagging horrendously and uncontrollably. Despite trying multiple fixes for this problem, the lagging and glitching persists. The match I enter will start, and then everyone in the lobby will be running and shooting in place just frozen, and I will continuously die randomly and not be able to do anything. Please fix this",1
"Overall one of the best shooter / action game on moblie. Graphics are great, Many modes to fight. Single & squad fights, always new challenges to earn new gun, gun skins, characters, skills and more..must download today!!",5
"The game is great, superb graphics, awesome playability... The bad side is it gives playing advantages for those willing to pay. It should be just about skills! Update: please do something about those millions of cheaters",4
"I have been playing this game since it was introduced. I love the game, graphics and weapons. The only thing I found unintelligible about the game was that everytime we receive an update and we install the update our ranks that we worked and played hard for and won have been reduced not just by one or two ranks but by about eight to nine ranks lower. Why is this happening? I wish you could come up with more ranks rather than decreasing the ranks we have earned. Thank You.",5
It's one of my favorite games but I want a better chance of getting skins and I want to level up faster lastly I want zombie mode please although all that it's a great game and will always be one of my favorite games but please bring back zombie mode I never played that mode üôè,4
I love it. We get new task to play and when we complete it so we get a reward it have many types of game in the world but codm is the best üëçüíØ It's graphics what to say about it's mind blowingü§Ø it have more than 30 modes in MPs and Bks . It is game of fun.,5
It's A Superb Game. It's Graphics Are Awesome. But Still it needs Optimization. Sometimes It's Lagging And Automatically Back To Home Screen During Game Play. Why Guns Damages Are Down And Reekoil Is High? There Are A Lots Of Bugs In Battle Royale. Please Fix It And Reduce The Size Of The Game.,4
"What happened to this game? The battle pass has gotten worse every season but this BP? WHY??? That is the hands down worst BP I've ever seen! Banana Blaster? Really? Whoever is in charge of the shop has apparently gave up on new content, now everything is just recycled every so often. The crates are all from seasons past and the bundles are terrible. Did you let a child takeover to see how it goes? So bummed, used to be my absolute favorite game...now I can't even get myself to play.",1
"I hade many error thing it took me 5-7 hours to fix,now it's all fixed but still this game needs improvement on bugs or error things but its really fun to play now it has lot of modes and the best part is the free skin thing üòÅ",5
"This game was amazing... now that so may people can choose to attack with gloves, sticks, axes, magic weapons, etc., there is an annoying and drastically unrealistic scale of deaths. One hit with a stick or boxing gloves kills me, but it takes MULTPILE gunshot wounds to kill them? Pretty soon this game will just be swords, sticks, and boxing gloves...",1
The game is really good but if you have a bad phone you can only have low frame rate and medium graphics and everything usually lags. Also battleroyal is just all laggy so that impossible to play. You start a few seconds later after the timer on a match and throwing lethal or tactical equipment makes you lags as well. Sometimes you will randomly get disconnected or just lag really bad to the point where it unplayable. But if you don't mind that then it's a good game.,3
"I keep having login errors for no reason, and for some time now, you guys still haven't rectified that. Every single time I update, to login into the game becomes a problem as I'll start getting login errors, I'll clear the cache but yet the same thing. Please how do I permanently remedy it?",1
"This game is absolutely exceptional. Both a positive and negative is it's constantly got new content. So updates are pretty regular. Customer support is actually really pretty quick and helpful. But the content is very addictive. My ol' lady is not a fan of the ""game"" that steals the attentive n from her. Good job dev.",4
"Really ugly graphics, game is very stuttery and unstable given the fact that it shouldn't be because of its ugly/weak textures. Overall can be better than PUBG but there's lots of work to do! Update: Graphics is still not good enough given that this game is now over 7+GB ü§¶üèæü§¶üèæ",2
"There's SO many pop up ads and bots!! It's almost unplayable!! The bots will cause you to lose the game if you're playing something like Search and Destroy, because all they do is run around in awkward circles. Then there's the HUGE amount of people who treat this app like it's a dating service of some kind. Then there's countless not accounts trying to convince people to go to some website where they can get $500 for giving up their personal info.",1
"This game is terrible. It used to be fun, but thanks to skill based match making its completely ruined. Camping, sentry gun/chopper gunner spam, k9s, broken weapons, tryharding, and generally pathetic behavior for any human being to engage in in the casual mode of a mobile game are done in every. single. match. There is no escape from this loop of aids except to uninstall. And its a shame because this was a good game, buts its now nearly unplayable. I was even about to purchase the battle pass.",1
Their new thing is that when pay for something in game they will take tour money and you wont receive the item you paid for. This happened tp me i already reported it to them and they have done NOTHING.(edit: still never fixed the last issue I had) New issue is over the last year I haven't played much because I can't EVER connect to a game and I have 5G service. So the issue is not on my end. Again it has been reported and NOTHING. And I have spent waaay more $$$$ than I WISH I Ever,1
"This is one of those really good mobile games. Lots of updates. New Maps, new guns. The only things that you can buy with irl cash are cosmetic and don't affect gameplay or the battlepass which includes only cosmetic items. So I enjoy it a lot. The game is well polished is getting some new game modes which makes it even better and makes the game play smoother. I usually don't enjoy COD but this I like a lot",5
"I freaking love this game but unfortunately when I close the app and again when I have to use and open, it is not visible even it gets back there is a bug and I am literally addicted towards it and help me to sort out this problem and if I have to play again first i have to clear the data then it appears I don't know what the heck is happening. I shall be very thankful and obligated if you will help me out! thank you‚ù§ we love you call of duty‚ù§üìå",5
Worst game in ever. This game is only for router player not for mobile data player. A lot of bugs and useless skins makes this game too laagy and frame drops. Am a season 2 player and i miss the old call of duty mobile. In now times call of duty is a boaring game.,2
I really think its a awesome game but the hackers in the game are getting too much thats why i only give 3 stars. Ive been playing since the game came out im good in it but the lagging and the bugs this game gives are way too much i would really like if you could start working on it for the time being so that the game experience for the people can be better please fix everything,3
"Awesome üëågame!! Old version of Zombies mode was more interesting and challenging, this was quite easy. Black out map is small and seems like there are lot of bots. üòõüòã",4
The newest update keeps making the game freeze. Uninstalled. Re installed. Same problem. So yall need to fix it. My phone is barely a year old. So that's not the problem lemme know when you fix it bye!!,1
Can't link my google account. Hours and hours of wasted advancement . Went to play and had to start from the beginning. Tried everything. Un and reinstall. link unsuccessful error. lvl 150 down the drain.,1
The glitches are extremely annoying my character keeps teleporting to a different location and when an enemy player is in your cross hair and should easily be killed your own character dies instead also it takes a while for the game to register that you killed an enemy player. Please fix.,3
"Another season, another update and the game keep crashing, lagging, bugging since last five seasons and now I have a new one, Fail detection in the hitboxes but the greedy timi and greedy Activision keep putting a lot of 100USD spins per season without fix the issues in the game like poorly performance, bugs, laggy servers and some cheaters in high levels of rankeds... bravo Timivision keep killing your game, new issue a lot of lag in every match. Activision-tencent only cares about money.",1
"This is one of those official cod games that revive all of the details and everything. You have a battle royale, maps from black ops and modern warfare and in between, plus a unique zombies experience all mixes to make this fun and addictive shooter, for even if you lose, you keep playing.",5
"My experience is great but the last update I lost my old account and all my legendary , and mythic guns skins can you please fix and I found some bugs especially with the rewind skill player's who use it goes invisable and only leaves a floating gun and you can't do damage to them fix the bug please",5
"Please fix the ninja perk. We now have no footsteps when they are close whatsoever and absolutely no sound or notification that they are around, they just appear in your face. You've nerfed the Traps, which don't do anything to the enemy because all they have to do is run out of it. The jetpack makes it impossible to even target an enemy at times. If you pay for the guns you win the game. Shotguns are too powerful even when you have good movement you lose. I'm done playing for awhile.",1
I love call of duty have played since the very first one. So when mobile came out was super excited. However I am sadly disappointed with the amount of players that use a glitch. Makes the game unfair. This needs to be addressed immediately.,4
Lma give it a 2 star there is a problem that when ever I try to log in call of duty then at the starting place when the board cones of season 5 2022 when I skip it then it makes me log in then the game just crashed force stop didn't work on it to u might fix this,2
"It takes all of my data when it's update came. Even in S5 update it takes 7.6 gb of mobile data. When I upar it it stops on 100 and it shows couldn't update plz update first. I update it 3 times, but it couldn't. This is the worst thing in this game CODM. Thank you CODM.",1
"I've been playing this game for years. It'd good, but they really need to crack down on hacks, aimbots, seeing through walls, etc. In addition mobile players should be paired with mobile players. It's way obvious when they play with a controller or mouse.",4
I think they should add speed variations of terrain and degrees of angles they move on as well as customize the speed of the skins movement like guns. Also prone should detail the grounds material when you get up. Also anti-tank guns are unrealistic as they are called antimaterial rifles. You can't blow up a tank with a rifle. Vehicles speeds should slow down when you crash into something and also damage the objects too. Helicopters should have weapons. Should add more guns from USA,4
"This is a great game but there is one major flaw. The auto-fire setting SUCKS! You can't fire through fences or doors like those using manual. You can't fire when someone is standing right next to you like those using manual, and it takes a frigging eon for your weapon to actually fire when it does work. Auto-fire is a serious disadvantage and it shouldn't be. Can you fix it?",2
"It's fun up until you begin quitting most of the matches you attempt to play due to modders and well organized teams that use camping and legendary weapons to keep you dying over and over again regardless of tactics. Just like all the other COD games... eventually the cheaters take over and ruin what could've been an amazing competitive game. But hey, trophies for anyone willing to pay the money.",2
"Its a very good and thought out game you can tell the craters put a lot of effort into the game but I have two problems one in multiple the response are really bad it seems like you always respon in the weirdest places and next to a enemy, number two any thing that is cool or looks nice all costs money almost every thing that is free looks bad and looks like no effort was put in to making the skin",4
"Great game, I love it... but it shouldn't be so difficult to find out how to contact support with a problem. Clan Wars is all messed up, I have screenshots and no where to send them. A node doesn't work at all cause the gameplay isn't available for it and another node has a spelling error. Someone please see this and fix it üò´",4
Was a great game. Been hooked since first uk lockdown. I'm actually pretty good at the game. But in recent updates I've gone from winning often to being paired against people that are quite clearly cheating or paying big money to play. I've gone from 10/12 kills per BR match to 1/2 and get wiped out by teams that are far more advanced with legendary weapons that make you disappear. It's no longer competitive. I guess I've got as far as I can without spending real money. No longer enjoyable.,2
"When it comes to graphics, it's one of the fewer mobile games with stunning graphics. But the gameplay has become more device based rather than skills. It will be better if the game is properly optimised for low end mobiles. Also it will be better if the crates are not rigged and a limit to microtransactions.",4
"Its a really good game. Some report problems regarding its sound but I experienced the most realistic sounds of bullet fire and other things without even downloading the package for better sound settings. Some even say that the players with better legendary gunn skins dominate the match, but if you have talent you can easily outplay power.",5
I really do love this game it has all the classic map from back in the day but also I have suggestions that could bring this game even more on top 1. Ballistic knifes we would go crazy for that 2. Keep Alcatraz as 24/7 BR people love Alcatraz but we only get to play it for a short time so please just keep it 3. The shield like in MW but in MP make it so the shield can actually take damage but in BR that it can't so the knifes can have fun with there loadouts that's I have to say thank you,5
"I'm reducing the 5 stars to be 2 stars only for being crashing in the middle of the game. Graphics turn in slow motion sometimes. Can't see players sometimes and just die over a shooting sound. Please, do the needful and fix these issues ASAP. Thanks",2
"The thing is, I am running this game in my 2gb ram 32gb storage phone. Keep it up for the performance it makes. But it consumes a lot more storage than expected. Can you please release an update where CoD:Mobile manages the storage efficiently, since this is the only problem with it.",4
"Great game, fun. The only thing thats difficult is each update the game just takes up soooo much storage. I use a moto g play, and I have now had to uninstall it because my phone doesn't have over 13gb to use it. I left the game for a few days and come back and all the maps and resources, we're partially installed all of a sudden. But yet it was still taking up ALL my phone storage. I'm fed up and saddened that the game only works if I have a super expensive phone with a shitton of storage.",2
"During a match, it will just black screen. I have to force stop the app then open it back up to play a round just to do this again. Fix this. This has been a bug since season 1, but now strikes every match instead of every few for me. I still have movement and can shoot, just not see anything but black. I still have full control of the phone during this. COD doesn't register as crashing during this",1
"Update: Lost a star. WAYYY too many bots! Great online game! I've only ever bought cp's once and then earned extra points...though it can be a slog to achieve. So much customisation and with such smooth game play it's a real joy. Update: July 2021. Genuinely not getting issues others report....yes it's a big download (15Gb on phone now), but not getting BR glitches or latency and updates always game over my WiFi!!! Best ""free"" game out there!",4
"Playing style is not like that screwed up pUbG. I'm happy this is different and similar to the OG PC game. And thank you for the 5v5 that was in previous games. Had lot of BO2 memory. After nearly 2 to 3 years when I came back to this game, there's no Google sign in. Tried the guest method but I could not retrieve it. This is my 3rd account which I've linked it with Activision. Either way I had fun, and now it's got monotonous and I've got bored. Might jump back in later.",4
"I absolutely love this game, but every time I try to download a package of any kind. Wether it be a weapon, map, or character it closes the app and then I have to open it back up. Not too happy with not being able to play my game without it crashing during a download üòûüôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",2
"The game is fun when it's not freezing up, and the sound stays on. These problems just started the end of last month, and are continuing this season. If these bugs get fixed it's a 5 out of 5 for sure. But as it is now only gets 3 üåü's",3
"Good enough game in general but the graphics seem pretty bad even at very high settings and it seems to have quite a bit of lag/ping compared to other similar sized mobile games. My biggest issue although is the constant updates; every other day, and this is not a exagerattion, there is a 100mb update starting download as soon as I log in. Please stop doing this...it's extremely annoying.",3
I have been playing it since it first released. It has the best graphics of any fps mobile I've ever seen including the PUBG mobiles who's graphics are horrible compared to this. Then there's also the fact that you don't have to spend money to play. Unlike others shooter games who say you don't but you have to. Great weapons. And always a new event. Getting tired of the same old battle royale on PUBG. Well there's always something new on this Call if Duty Mobile.,5
Really wanted to like it. Downloaded. Set up account. Chose 1st gun. Cant connect to server. Constantly disconnects and loops back to login screen. NEVER actually been able to join a game ! Increased score as recent updates have improved the game considerably. Still have issues using controller though.,4
"Been playing this game for over a year and now when I try to download the in game content my app completely shuts me out after 2 seconds of starting to download, thought maybe this was just a uninstall than reinstall problem but it didn't fix it, in fact made it worse, making me unable to download any in game content what so ever along with the game crashing mid battle Royale game or multiplayer. Needs some SERIOUS fixes and quick!",1
"Impressive. Best phone game I've played, considering graphics, extent, and free for me to play. I used to spend money here and there for skins guns etc. but I haven't paid for anything for a couple years now. The free game play alone keeps me playing üëç And the controls are great. I prefer the phone over the controller now.",5
"Its's turned into Fortnite with all the silly skins and emotes it takes up almost 20gb. It's disappointing when I jump on to play it's always an update that tacks on another 2 gb every update. Soon the game will be too big for the phone. Who downloads a 20gb game on their phone? I'm sorry but it's gotten out of hand to the point it's destroyed a once cool game. Stop adding ""show and tell"" items. Nobody cares what you look like when a bullet goes between your eyes. Developers take note!!",1
The game is fun and all but with constant connection errors at times it's unplayable. I mostly play on a stable 5G connect or on wifi and it still gives me problems. I've gotten a new and better phone since the last time I played and it's giving me the same issues with lag. With World Championships coming up I'd think they'd make more of an effort to deal with these problems.,2
"I'd love to give you 5 stars but until the controller issue is fixed, I simply can't. This game is perfectly set up for controllers. No other app had this issue, please fix it so I can up this rating to 5 stars. Minecraft, Sky, Tacticool, and endless other games can all support my controllers, what is YouR excuse? Controller users are incredibly better than touch screen users because they learned to strafe left and right to disable our targeting.",2
"First off I love the COD Franchise have played for years. I love the expansion to mobile devices. However the pay to win vs. regular players is wildly tilted in their favour. There was a change to ranked Multiplayer vs Non Ranked matches, Normal matches I end 10-5 or so within Ranked matches I'm lucky if 2 kills. The damage ratio on guns is uneven, Pistols vs Assault and I died using the Assault. PLEASE make the game like it was when you started the mobile expansion & bring back original zombies",2
Game is good... But I think you've the need to upgrade your servers in India... As in daytime it works fine but at night it even doesn't open.. by chance it opens the server connection lost dialogue box comes in between game and after many retries it not reconnect so I forcefully relaunch the game. It really sucks,3
"No support for switch pro controllers, it's not that difficult to just allow all Bluetooth controllers and allow key mapping... huge file size, impossible to play with touch controls so I will be uninstalling. Hopefully they will add some game pad support and I will re download",3
This is the most crash prone game I've ever played besides Life After. My device has more than 4 gb of ram yet it overheats before I even get into a lobby it happens again and again just from trying to download the maps! Let alone crashing midway through ranked matches I'm trying to qualify for the codm championship.,1
"So, I haven't been in CoD Mobile for a long time. Last 2 years, I've changed from a Huawei device. The game worked just fine. Now I want to come back to check out the game again ever since the break I took. I've been trying to get into the game on my brand new phone but I keep getting this issue where it says that I need a stable internet connection. I have no issues whatsoever with my network. I tried restarting my device, clearing cache but nothing worked. Please for the love of God help.",5
"June 25, 2020: Game runs pretty good, especially on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus (Qualcomm). Graphics and frame rates are pretty good and excellent. Max settings and very high quality. ‚Äê--------------- April 9, 2022: N10+ (Qualcomm) endures horrendous frame drops that seldom hit 40FPS. Graphical quality remains steady; this originates from poor optimization with One Ui 4.1. (Ironically, One Ui 4.0 remained steady). Hoping for an optimization update---soon.",3
This game is absolutely amazing. Its quality is really good for a mobile game and its not to much of a pay to win game although it requires a bit to much space to install which is kind of annoying since i dont like deleting a bunch of my stuff but once you get space for it next update you're gonna have to try and gain more space over and over again. Besides from my own space issues this game is great as a call of duty can i have to give this game cresit for the effort put into it.,5
It's been a great game until recently. The game will not load up and crashes at the initial load screen. I've restarted my device and uninstalled/reinstalled it several times with no fix. Very frustrating and disappointing.,2
Need to fix the issue of being kicked off the game every match! Can't get a full game in without the game shutting off. It was good for the first 3 to 4 hrs I started playing. But now it barely makes it past the load screen before kicking me out of the game.,1
"I was too good at the game, I originally got this for zombies, but the gamemode never showed up, if you like aimbot this is the game for you... constantly grinding levels until you find actual players... i just wish it was a bit more challenging. Anyways they cut too much out to save room.",3
Cod is the beat games ever because I've been play it every since 2019 it's so fun. Some problems that I've ran into is that every time I go in the car it keeps on making me go out. But I think that's only me because on my other phone it works. One more thing in BR when I play a game ther are bots right but some time when I'm in a gun fight when a bot runs up to me it distracts me and annoyed me so that's it I hope you fix it.,5
"The game is so good and full of action, the graphics is amazing, but I will suggest CODM support all kinds of controller, it's so painful my Bluetooth controller can't play CODM, I will also suggest the team should come up with a story mode like it's in console... I look forward in playing CODM story mode soon!!!",5
"It's just a graphical improvement,but i wish that when we scope in, the sights should be at a distance from the screen like the desert eagle because the sights are too close to the screen, it will bring a more MW19 feeling to it. Thanks!",5
"game is good and I like it, but I can't use the high graphics option, I don't even see it, I downloaded the HD resource pack but it doesn't show in the settings, if my device can't run it on HD quality then I'd like to know, but if it can then that's a bug I want you to fix.",4
"The reason why I gave This app 2 star is because one, bullets can kill you underwater, two m13 bullets can penetrate a armored vehicles armor, three the br barrier is a problem. It Forces us to walk straight to death its like would rather to die by enemy's or would rather die by the going outside the barrier, I don't recommend pointless game.",2
"Great game been playing it for 1 year but with the recent update I'm quite disappointed. You see Back then we had optional graphic selection but now it gives you the graphics depending on your device. I'm quite disappointed since before it was all beautiful epic gameplay but now everything's blurry and very unpleasant to play,So I request to the Devs to please remove the feature and give us our own selection. Thank you.",2
"The game is good for a free game. The one main problem is that it seems to lose connection when on mobile network. This is annoying because the signal is satisfactory. Its a shame really because it takes some beating for a free game in other areas. My mate has the same problem, he has iPhone and I have Samsung. The developers need to sort the glitches for it to be 5 stars.",4
"Worst. I am clearly connected to wifi, all the other apps using the net are working fine. This game tells me to 'make sure I am connected to the internet and try again'! Before you can start playing, loading takes place at least 5 times! Disappointed.",2
"Very impressive, and very surprising in that it is just as good as console quality. Great graphics and addicting gameplay. One of the best games for android so far, without a doubt! EDIT---I took a star off because this is one of the few games that doesn't support the Razer Kishi controller. It makes no sense that it doesn't work with this game!!! Can you please add support for the Razer Kishi controller in the next update???",4
"The game is good butI have a problem... once the game has started and finished loading upto the login screen, i press the call of duty option inorder to login to my account, but instead the game keeps on restarting, i have tried countless times and it does the same thing...pls help",3
"It's a fun game there are alot of events and always new modes, however, the drawback is that the only real way to get anything worthwhile is to spend cash to buy cp to buy draws for legendary items and I just don't see how that's right or fair, I could understand having to accomplish certain missions and achievements but to have to spend 100 bucks to get 10k cp and have to buy everything in that category or draw just to get a legendary weapon with effects is ridiculous.",3
"Please change BR maps according to themes set. Deep sea should have been all under sea adventure type. And kindly keep changing BR maps, so as to keep your loyalty base. The gameplay has become worst, kindly improvise the functionality. We don't need in any way, a 35 day season, 28 days or roughly 30 day season will do.",2
"I don't like playing this game again. None-stop render and high ping/ms problems even when I have fast internet. I don't know if it's a server problem so please fix this. I cleared the cache on COD but it didn't work and I have a more than capable device to handle this game . Also with the latest update mid-game the game keeps crashing and even on low graphics drains my battery a lot. It's been about 3-4 years also and I still haven't got a response to my original review, bad response service.",1
Love the codm app. But I wish they would bring back zombies classic ü•∫üò≠ü§ßü•¥ Doesn't stop me from playing though. Also I can't leave without mentioning the maps in this game. The memories over the years of playing CoD on other platforms. Im greatful for bringing back the old maps back.,5
"Fun game and all have been playing for years, but ever since I redownloaded it again after about 6 months, the app is constantly crashing on me, and it's starting to really piss me the heck off. I've tried almost everything to fix the issue but nothing is working. Can someone from tech support please contact me, so they could help me with this issue. I would rate 5* but I can't because of the sudden and consistent crashing of app. Thank you COD mobile, and please have someone contact me asap.",1
This game is very good and all but the game is sometimes pay 2 win so maybe if they frequently added much better free skins in the credit shop it would be a great game and there is some lag even on a high end device now other than that there is nothing wrong with the game. I did not mean to like insult the developers or something.CODM is a great game it's super fun to play with friends.If you want to try it out then of course try it. I myself encouraged at least 20 people to download this game.,5
This is one of the best shooting games I have ever played and it probably will be for a little while and I recommend downloading it and the bugs need to get fixed I would get kicked out of games I don't know why and I have goon wifi and good enternet so they need to get that fixed it would make the game a lot better and easier to play and it is not that hard to get lives it feels like eny more and you will have a lot of fun while playing this game.,5
"The game was great, I repeat ""was"", in battle royal there used to be medications to heal yourself and no shield and there used to be guns with different levels, grey, green, blue, purple, yellow, then red, in the recent updates they have taken them out, they have also nerfed all the guns in battle royal (made them less lethal, taking off damage and range), this game is still ok I do get entertained by this game but please bring back the old features (medications, different levels with the gunsüëç",4
"Great game. I really wish I could use both the crossbow and the katana simultaneously in one loadout. Please either make it so that you can equip 2 secondaries or make the crossbow (or katana) a primary. Also, please fix the katana's range. I still refuse to believe that a SWORD has less range than a KNIFE. It's ridiculous. Make It's range stat say 12 or 13. In game, it has around the same range as the axe. Edit: they brought back the cage map. 5 stars.",5
"Honestly, best game on the app store. Multiplayer is pretty fun even if most of the marksman rifles are as effective as throwing dog poop at someone. Battle Royale is probably the best part of the game, Alcatraz being my favorite map.... probably because it's ripped straight from black ops 2 zombies. Speaking of zombies, Undead Siege kinda blows. The day segments are pretty boring and freaking Farm on Isolated with the usual round structure would be better. Nights are quite intense though. End.",5
"This is a great game, I hate you have to pay like $100 dollars just to get the special items, which they suppose to be picked at random but the skins and the special weapon is always picked last, which means you have to spend more money, and the battle pass seem to take forever now to get to level 50 even with the premium pass.",2
"Best FPS game on Android by far. One huge problem, getting consistent lag and connecting to server issues here from South Africa is causing the game to become unplayable. Myself and at least 6 members in my clan have stopped spending money on the game as it's pointless with all the lag issues. It's not our phones nor our fibre line speeds either.",3
review update: this is one of my favorite games I've played since the very first second season.. I would have played first season but no controller support and the only other reason why I'm on the Google play store looking for another fps game is no call of duty campaign as much as I like br & mp I want a CODM CAMPAIGN !! I haven't played CODM in over a year and I used to buy the battle pass every time I came out for years I loved the game just got bored .. so sad..,5
"At the moment I cannot recommend. Ranked matchmaking in multiplayer seemed fine until I hit Elite 1 rank and then I started getting placed in servers halfway across the world. For unranked that is all good, but for ranked, any kind of matchmaking that places the player at a 200+ ping disadvantage is flat out unacceptable.",1
What is wrong with the game crashing every time why?!!!! It has crashed more than 500times since I downloaded the game 1month ago. It crashes like 20times in a row. It's a great game but that crashing is driving me nuts. It mostly crash when I'm entering an arena or being revived in Battle Royal. What that heck guys?!!!!üò†üò†üò†üò†,3
I really like this game but 4 times today alone it has crashed and I'm being charged XP points as if I left a ranked match (which I would never do unless it was an absolute emergency). What makes things worse I'm gettin bammed and there is no easy way to contact support and inform them of what's going on.,3
"It's a good game in total, but I think you should rework the use of non gone weapons such as swords, dogs etc, they're a total overkill, it's one hit and you're done, that's a little bit over the grid, much more dangerous than a bullet, you need to do better than that guys.",2
"Smooth Multi-player matchmaking. Great gaming for downtime. The battle Royale mechanics are not that great, especially sniping. But the mechanics for multi-player are responsive. Overall I love the game play and meeting new friends to conquer matches with whether it be rank or unranked.",5
Would have been an easy 5 stars. But recently they keep adding new stuff and it's gotten to the point that it's almost unplayable unless you have the flagship devices because of the constant frame drops even on low graphics. I have to rage quit most of the times. Edit: thank you for introducing mac-10. This is exactly what we needed. Faster time to kill gun that kills you even before you can ads with your assault rifle. Thank you cod mobile. But it still feels weak. Please buff it with akimbo.,1
"The game is unplayable after the last update. Before that i never had a problem regarding performance, now the game is lagging constantly even though i lowered to the minimum all the graphics. Plus is overheating thr phone like crazy and draining the battery really fast. This all happened ater the last update before that i didn't have any of these issues.",1
"Since the recent update it has started hanging so much. I used to play this game regularly with my clan members but now it's a nightmare. My phone is decent and used to handle it pretty nicely. But since the recent update it just keeps on crashing everyday. Tried reinstalling it, didn't work out. I allowed ample time, hoping it would get fixed in the next updates but found only disappointment to follow. I'm so dissatisfied with these bugs. Please fix it soon.",1
"The game is amazing. High graphics, good gameplay and an overall great game. Put there is a major pet peave of mine, it doesn't have to do with gun nursing but events. I have been seeing a bunch of events from other people but it doesn't seem to pop up for me.",4
It's a good game until you come across cheaters. Btw when I'm playing ranked Battle Royale the screen freezes and then it takes me back to my home screen. Making me load back into the game and sometimes it completely disconnects me from the match causing me to lose my BR Points. And on the other hand this App takes up way to much of my storage. I'll give it a 5 when you guys decide to fix *Update Just uninstalled. Bugs and everything is ridiculous.,1
First of all I love this game I've been playing for a month and a half now and I am in level 150. But I have some issues with the game that I want to be fixed: 1. Auto download without my permission. 2. Too many updates that leads to lagging. If it's like this I might stop updating. It needs to be optimized. 3. Lucky draw is rigged. They save the best prices for last. It's annoying. 4. Too many clan wars. I mean don't like that because I played clan wars alot and it affected me mentally.,4
"I love the skins and gunsmith stuff, but I'd like to color every part of the gun to my liking. For example I want the mag color to be tan and the optic to be tan but everything else I want black. I would love to see that. Secondly, Character Customization. Stuff like glasses, helmets, bandanas etc. (A gunsmith but for your how your character looks ) For example some rare cosmetics would give you 5% extra XP, or different helmets would reduce damage to the head. Add the ACOG optic for ARs and SRs",5
"The game used to run smooth earlier. After they added so much to the game it started lagging. It has bugs like even if you tick mark fill squad it doesn't do it, I enter the game alone and no teammates are there. I have a 200mbps 5ghz internet yet it lags. The battle royal lags like hell as well even with lowest graphic settings when the earlier versions of the game used to run very well.",2
"Pretty good I'll admit I didn't think it would be good. But I was wrong. I'll admit the way controls are nice! excellent. I am not really good at FPS games, but I like this game. The in store draws. They should have an option to buy all now. it's not really a draw. The way the draw goes is you have to spend to get what you want. The likelihood getting anything good is. You have to spend. There is no lucky, just spend.. üòâ ***note: I am aware these are cosmetics. No need to spend***",5
"I play on a Sony Xperia 5 Mk. 3 and the game keeps dropping my WiFi and makes the game unplayable. My WiFi works fine with other games. Nonetheless, the characters in last 2 seasons have been good! I'd love to see more characters like Roze (Foreshadow), Domino, Pixel Spy, Mara, Riggs, Demir, Vanguard, and Dark Shepherd in the battle pass not in draws or drops. Oh and the FR 556 needs to be buffed. A faster rate of fire would be nice and make it feel like similar to a real FAMAS.",2
"Well its a call of duty game. You need a lot space on whatever device are playing on. I am sooooo happy controller players play against controller players. It makes playing without 1000 times better. I will never understand why the gaming community needs 10,000 different ways to customize your character but its cool. Game play is smooth. I mostly play on wifi, mobile data works but it be slow. Word of advice. USE THE PRACTICE MODE! I was getting 1 or 2 kills per game and now getting 20+ a game.",4
I think it's a Great games with a lot of cool features but I think it could get even better by adding a rope mode to the helicopters in battle. So it would like when you play battle royal and you the helicopter you see where the the switch a seat button you would see like a little rope be side it so a person on the side seat press it would enable them to side on it while the pilot hovers the aircraft,5
"Like the game but recently I keep dieing bc of the dumbest thing. Sometimes during a deathmatch, it will be crowded with players from both sides so I hit my teammates on accident. But I keep dieing bc of these small accidents. Is there a way to turn this off or wut bc this is very annoying as someone who mainly plays deathmatch and Frontline.",4
"The recent update is trash. Been playing continuously for more than a year and half. Now it shows no internet connection even after a fast internet. I've downloaded HD quality movies in few minutes but can't open this game. If it opens after a thousand tries, I get high ping. What's wrong with COD-M",2
Fabulous game but needs improvements on downloads enormous files are making my phones battery life die. I personally think it is a great mobile FPS game for beginners or people who are looking for a new game to explore this is probably the perfect. The only downside is probably AI bots in some servers they are pretty easy to kill so I really want Activision to improve the game so it can be the same for others. I hope you enjoy the game!,4
I really love this game and the overall experience but the only thing that I'm having a problem with is that everytime i play a match or just play it's always crashing and kicking me out of the game also the prices for items on the shop is ridiculously high can you please fix this!!,4
Ever since the new season I've been having repeated controller connectivity issues. I'm using a PS4 controller. Connects to the phone and functions just fine but the game won't recognize controller input. This is extremely frustrating as I play ranked matches.,2
"I really do want to give this game 5 stars but after the new update my phone screen goes black many times in S&D and only after playing 1 round. And now it starts lagging and am very upset that I was facing issues while playing. Kindly do needful because I really love this game and I want to play it continuously, but because of these issues am unable to play 2 or 3 matches.",4
"The graphics are good very detailed. A very action packed game, you have to be on your toes or you won't last long, you'll get shot or blown up, pretty fun. The Internet doesn't always come in so you get some glitches and it does mess up your already started game. Otherwise a good game very entertaining.",4
"Good game, but there are a few things that would love to see. 1- original Zombies mode, sure the one we have now is fun but it gets a bit bland after 10 games. 2- Prestige mode! Maxed to level 150 easily and maybe with prestige could have more weapon skins or attachments. 3- Ranked points on performance when loss is way too much. 35 points lost from a game with 10 kills and spawncamping? C'mon man",4
"This is a great game is been playing since Season 2, but I just reinstalled this on my tablet, agree I am sitting in a room with great wifi, and cannot connect to the game. Stop the ads, optimize for better performance on mobile devices. And port to iOS services for people on Chrome.",4
The game is now extremely laggy. And after every update the lag increases and so happened in this update also! Similar games with more high graphics works perfectly and so smoothly in my device. This game is not optimized and even lags in some expensive devices. This is so annoying as you die every time coz of the lag. Earlier this game worked really smoothly but now it is unplayable coz of lag. They need to fix this ASAP.,1
"I have played this game since first released, everything about it is great. What i want to be added is the classic zombie where you open doors repair windows and fight the bos at the end. I really hope this i added because a lot of players played this game just for this.",5
"Overall the game is too good there is amazing graphics and controls . But the thing is that this game is dying because we get too many updates with too many guns. So, stop bringing new guns because the players are setting there hand in particular gun and you are bringing new gun so it is difficult to set the hand in new guns and to find that which is the best gun so stop bringing new guns and start making tournament for all regions regular like in one two months this will upgrade cod.",4
"Been playing since day one and it used to be fun so when I stopped a while back I finally decided to play again now. It's not fun at all, just expect to constantly lose because they fill your team with bots at random. Sometimes I'll have actual teammates, 98% of the time though it's just bots. Bots that die so easily that no matter how good you do you just lose because they give the enemy so many kills. Needs optimization on the exynos 1280 chip too, should be getting more stable gameplay",2
Its great if you have a damn good phone that's very fast like iPhones or galaxy phones but it will freeze lag for like 5 seconds randomly it always has that's the only bad part about this game and that my setting for sensitivity gets reset or something allot because I'll have it one way then drop in and suddenly when I aim my character. Acts like he is holding a warm aching he can't turn...random controller issues making it unable too be a feature which is very strange but it works asof now,5
Pissed Off...game keeps crashing and penalizing me when crashes in ranked..I go by ESHNBL1TZD in game I'm better than good don't need controller for game like others. but how can I do championship and clan challenges if i'm constantly having to deal with these problems... PS it's nothing to do with my phone..... Fix the game or I will have to delete instead of paying for data to download the next update.,3
"You gotta fix your low graphics settings, people just appear out of nowhere and delete yoy from existance, and there's still that bug where the game freezws for like 2 seconds. Every time I die because someone spawns infron tog me just makes me want to unistal the game even more, I'm sure I'm not the only one this happens to.",2
"I've not played as much lately & it's not as fun as it once was lobbies are filled with bots to where prior to these past couple seasons i never got any nukes in ranked that i recall, it was much tougher to do but now I've gotten several nukes in ranked play, it's not matter or above cause i just haven't played enough but pro, it was a lot more competitive back than through most tiers now it's not like that until you reach legendary. this is in my experience so could be different for others.",4
"I like multiplayer, battle royale is cool too, undead zombies mode SUCKS!!! Horrible!!! I always enjoyed playing zombies solo as much as, maybe more, than playing zombies with other players. A nice relaxing round based solo match of zombies is why I loved call of duty. That's why I I rate this 2 stars. 1 for tryin, 1 for multiplayer mode.",2
I love this game it's so good no ads in the game so enjoyable but there is something I really need to tell about. Like the game is good but it should be updated so that some things should be bought with credits instead of actual money like it's not all the time I have money to use to buy things like the FERG SKIN in couldn't buy it or buy COD POINTS please help us to change this and THEATRE mode should be added so that you can rewatch your matches. Other than this the game is very good,5
So ive been facing this bug where everytime i get close to an enemy my game pauses for a 1 to 2 seconds and then it shows players names and says reconnected like for example (player1445 reconnected) on the left side of the screen and i get killed everytime and in the lobby i have like 50 ping please fix this i think it makes one of the best shooting game unplayable,3
"The issue is after registering in championship, I got a match which was in progress and lost it to a 22-150 and it got recorded as 3 lost matches, 2 won which was unfair, I would greatly appreciate if this was rectified in next championship and not to record any such match which is in progress whether won or lost. And I would greatly appreciate if there was a buttton which is optional and the work of it is on your favourite weapon you can chose whether it will be ads or hip fire Remove K9 unit",3
This is the best fps game I have ever played in mobile . It's graphics and texture detailing are so nice that it looks like it is a pc exclusive game . I am playing this game from when it is officially launched (mote than 3 years) and it gives me an excellent experience. Thank you Activision for making this masterpiece . üíú,5
Great game. It's really fun to take a squad and play battle royal. And versus is a awesome game mode. I wish the would play campaign mode in the game. But I just don't like the pay to win and If you have a favorite character you must pay real money for them.,4
This game is hands down amazing the controls are so easy to use and there is some great competition **Update** game is still go just very upset because every time I try to download the new data my game crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing works. Until this gets fixed I'm sticking at a 3 star review,3
"Best FPS out there. It is becoming the benchamark of online game competions worldwide. But not worthwhile beacause... After years of playing and having thousands of Southern African/American/Australian players there is still no nearby servers provided for dedicated fans. It is really unfair to be paired against our UK, Asian and US players trying to grind stats with a ping of 80-120ms. While improving the gameplay please try to expand your infrastructure also.",2
"If you like aimlessly running in circles and getting killed by other people running around killing eachother in circles it's the perfect game for you if you're looking for a game thays more realistic and want to have any type of teamwork or strategy this isn't it, it's horrible nobody here has strategy they just run in to be killed over and over again. Kids game",1
"Continue to have issues with audio going in and out during MP match's. fYI I get a constant 47 to 62ms On a good device. Can't even play ranked its so bad. the championships are going on, can't compete in them because of these issues. Not even going to mention, the frame drop and lag. I will say that it appears to me that when I'm on during times of low server use ""less people logged in"" I don't have the audio drop as often. In BR.. Don't seem to have the audio issues like in MP.",1
"Best game in the world. I love this game with all my heart. After this recent groundwar update, it almost feels like there's a hardcore battle royale, light machine guns and several other weapons now work like they're supposed to. The revolver handgun should be 1 headshot = 1 kill across map even without Stopping power rounds and Ground war should last 3x as long. With certain attachments the SP-R 208's range can be brought down to 36. that's ridiculous, a sniper rifle worse than a shotgun",4
"Great game, terrible file size and CONSTANT updates! It's freaking ridiculous how much storage this game takes AND the never ending updates aren't helping! I try to play several times a week but it's getting too time consuming now that it takes longer to download all the updates than I have time to play. Clearly the development team is ridiculously over staffed if they have so much time to create more useless updates that have literally no impact on game play.",2
"This game is the best game on Google play you can use Camos and use too many things it make you kill the people and all of maps and weapons are nice Playing on phone and computer it can work nice but I think on phone is better than the computer there are too many downloads you can download it it's for free and it's not virus I mean it can't hack/virus your phone/computer but the bad thing is zombies mode because its for limited time. It's a famous game, I liked it but more modes isn't limited :)",5
"If you prefire and aim correctly but your bullets don't register then no one should bother playing only.. Yes and 1 star is the least I could give, trust me if i was to show how it matches you up with teammates and opponents you will be surprised. They only put new things in the game and quality of processing declines. For your peace of mind don't do the things I did like playing the game or spending money, you would not be disappointed.",1
"It's decent if it loads, but it just never loads. There are constantly long updates, so I can't really ever play it. You can't even use a different app or shut off your phone during this, you have to be in app staring at the bland screen. If you close out of it, the update/loading progress resets",2
"One of the best action games. I love the graphics, the maps, everything is amazing. Would recommend fixing the bugs. There are random delay, button bugs in the game.",5
"Love the game. Wish they bring back the old school zombie mode. The new one is so-so... its okay, just a little too hectic; it definitely feels like a consistent survival mode especially keeping up that base.",5
Had to change to 1 star because of all this freezing. I have a new iPad and I'm still lagging every game even when my ms is not dropping. The waiting time for games are also ridiculously long now. I have to wait over 100 seconds just to get into a game just for it to end even quicker because the meta is so broken right now. The mac-10 is not even giving me a chance to shoot back and kilo-141 has no recoil with such high damage.,1
Overall I love COD but lately I have been having a problem! I can play multiplayer all day long kill my phone over and over and works just fine! Then I okay one match of BR and my service drops out and the game crashes everytime! I can't ever finish a game without connection to my wifi but I lag on wifi is anyone else having this problem?!,5
"Absolutely dire controls This game says I'm better than 97% of players - that's how bad control is. Controls stick, you can be running and you're unable to stop, frantically pawing at the controls trying to get it to respond. It's appalling even with 10ms. You can't disable capacitive buttons anymore so I keep getting sent back to the launcher - usually right at the critical moment. Constant massive downloads on update are a pain especially as you have to then update all the assets each time.",1
"Hi, this game is amazing specially this season! But it would be great if there was a kind of button to stop automatic downloading, because there not a lot of storage in phone to download all the packages in it..",4
"The game itself is perfect for being a mobile game, just someone please patch the controller system. My ps4 controller can connect to the phone and all the buttons work until i get in a match. Only the pause, quick melee, tactical and lethal buttons work.",4
"Update on my review: Call of Duty Mobile is amazing because it's free to play and has large variety of weapons across Black Ops, Black Ops II, Black Ops III, Black Ops IIII, and now Modern Warfare 2019! I love how many weapons there are and it allows lots of gunsmith customization for all of them! Although, this game does seem to crash sometimes on me, but it's not that bad. Anyways, I rate this game 5/5 stars. Thanks a lot for Call of Duty Mobile!",5
"Hi! developer, i love this game so much, but getting low FPS and laggy experience in my new IQOO 9 SE device inspite of having high graphics and frame rate support. I've felt that it needs optimization and support to give it 60FPS-90FPS frame rate for wonderful experience. I'll wait for a new update and fix for it. waiting for your reply too! thanks in advance!",1
The game started off great! Until i start winning and all of a sudden I'm getting all these gliches like virus is being put in the game. I have to constantly delete and re download every so often. Not good!,2
"I really loved playing this game but you need to fix it. I already have 3 complaints about this game. 1st of all,when I use the speaker in the microphone, it always breaks up. 2nd of all,when I end a match it offen resets my phone. Lastly, the one I hate the most is that the game keeps on removing my account from the game and I have to start over. It just happened to me know and this is the 6th account I made in this game. I'm getting very annoyed of this continuing. Please fix your game.",2
"This game is cruel. Awful graphics that have no hope for being updated, tons of things that require manual download, and full of purchasable DLC that is half-baked in design and looks bad. The one time I banked on a draw in this game I didn't get the best parts of the rewards, the odds are all rigged and no matter how many times you play you'll just get the reward with the highest odds (which are the worst parts of the draw). The gameplay is okay aside from maybe some stability/mobility issues.",1
Adding groundwar mode is good step up. Glad you listening to the fans demand. It will be better if more maps will aded in Groundwar mode. Regarding the increasing size user should able to choose what they want to play in more intuitive way. So they only install those parts of game which they like to play.,4
This update is terribly bad.The new BR graphics is worst. Every is so much fogy and the basic cod feature is lost. it's losing it's originality.In between road are not needed.The graphics looks just like a 1* action game or a cartoon..the grass field are just destroyed by the graphics.Bus station Map is also destroyed. Worst update ever.if this update continues i will just stop playing the game.,4
Why the game keep glitching I have a Samsung A10 good internet and it keep on lagging in BR and multiplayer hard to play these days with so much glitch. I can't see the enemies they just appear major glitch even when I'm using sniper I can't see the enemies don't know what's the problem and I have enough space. I can't see the enemies near or far would like that to be fix,1
"I would give it 5 stars but there is this bug which annoys me everytime and all the codm players personally know says the same thing to, here is the bug-most of the time when me and my team are right about to win the enemy's kill counter goes up by each second even when we are at 142 kills and there are at 102, So i would love it if you'd fix it Thankyou.",3
"Terrible spawns in team deathmatch, unbalanced guns you guys add kilo into the game and buff it for it to have less recoil when it already shreds then recently release the mac 10 a gun that simply should not be in the game because of how ridiculously fast you die already to guns with less fire rate and matchmaking in ranked takes years. I literally either face or get teamed with the same exact people every time I find a match after waiting so long.",1
Let me just start with the game is super slow. Also when you connect your controller it sometimes cannot register your system that your using. I would give it a review that would make people wanna get it. But theres way too many issues with this game. Fix the programming a bit and make it run cleaner on mobile. I can get at most 20 to 30 kills only because the firing mode says headshot when you shoot them in the leg. Yeah ok......,1
"This is by far the best mobile game I've played in my life. Almost perfect, and it gets better every season. I've socialized more here than I have on Facebook. Its pretty amazing. But issue is why need to keep downloading my guns, camo and stuff that already exist and that I own every seasonüò°. In this part of the world, data is luxury. Please I don't want to deal with that next season or I'm moving to PUBG which actually looks like the Chinese version of this gameü§£.",5
"Man it makes me sad cuz I've played this game for over 2years and there are so many improvements that i can't explain but, there are still some things developers need to fix ik they're doing their hardest to make the game better but some Improvments can literally change the game forever and better, these issues if fixed can be the solution for everything wrong 1.PING SPIKE 2.DSYNC(ik it's less but it is still one of the WORST) 3.FPS DROP when your FPS goes from 60 to 25 LITRALLY on MAX framerate",3
"It's a good game, the graphics is really good for a mobile game but the problem is the graphics settings. I use realme 8 5g but the graphics is stuck in medium settings and high fps. Whenever I play I get a stable 60fps so I think it can handle 90fps too. Please let us use our 90hz displays in mid end phones. I don't know if it will work or not but we should at least try. I want to experience 90fps too so please (‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•)",3
"Great game, awesome graphics Though the lags that occur in BR are kinda upsetting please try to make this fix Otherwise the game is just simply amazing You should try it out guys another thing is, why do we have to redownload almost all our camos, skins and maps once a new update arrives. This really needs fixing",5
"Game play was fun, but it is now plauged with bugs and lag issues. Game physics is wayy off. No choice of hardcore games and ranked games with random spawns is beyond ridiculous. Pros: Not pay to play and has plenty of weapons to choose from.",2
"The game is fantastic, just one suggestion if Activision adds on Fighter Jets instead of helicopter and adds small war ships in game then that would be be more awesome because the helicopters are slow in air attack like if 2/3 helicopters are fighting in squad matches then it's very difficult for us and when ever the last zone finishes in around the coast of in the ocean it becomes more difficult to survive , just a suggestion",5
"Overall great game, but there's a problem with season 3 with ping spike issues which really needs to be fixed asap, I've been wanting to play for 3 days but everytime i start mp or br, i keep having ping spikes ans some serious bug problems and I'm not the only one having this issue, everyone i know is having the same issue and it must be fixed soon.",2
"Downloaded the game over wifi. Then they asked for one update first right after, couldn't download over wifi. Switched to data, done. Then again one more update, nothing over wifi. Mobile data is on- done. Gameplay over wifi, not working again. I double checked my wifi comnection, restarted the device. Same problem. Weird app. Uninstalled.",1
"Great games but there's a lot of glitches. Most annoying one is in Battle Royale where the in game message doesn't match the VA. So if you need ammo, all you can say is 'I have ammo'. Like it doesn't even make sense.",3
"Game keeps crashing, sound only available through headphones. There's too much being shoved into this game, it takes up so much storage. It used to be great, but after the last few updates it's becoming unplayable.",1
This game is in my opinion. God tier. Not only are the graphics ahead of every otherobile game I've seen so far the mechanics are easy to grasp. This game is not really pay to win. The only thing you pay for is cp Wich is used for skins. Absolutely no ads whatsoever. One downside is that it takes up a bit of storage so youight wanna keep that in mind. Also this game does not use very much data Wich is insane considering what all happens in game. Good job on the developers of the game. Good job!!,5
Really is an awesome game to play in your free time. Great graphics!! Awesome team atmosphere and reward for play! Ive seen a few reviews that was complaining about having to pay to get any extras. Thats simply not true!!!!,5
"The network error 4A28 remains a constant pain. I have no clue why there are no patches for such a minor issue. I see massive updates cropping up all the time, but no network error patches. Ruins the whole mood of the gameplay.",2
I've had no problems really except 2 things I think you guys should add back the old zombies and also make a campaign I know they take a while but just a suggestion for the future the campaign s are always the best part in COD games because sweats aren't trying to kill you and the storyline (IE black ops 1 and 2 and ghosts),4
"I don't even know where to begin, this game is dead and will continue to decline if things continue. I recommend you don't waste your time on this game, The ranked system is a mess and it's impossible to go anywhere with it.The weapons are unbalanced and constantly nerfed, you can shoot a guy first yet you will die beause he's using a meta. CODM like the rest of the new COD games has gone in a decline and are only after your money, The multi-player ranked system is also utter trash.",1
Game is good but it has alot of bugs like I click for scope or the fire button and nothing happens. I don't get why!!! Still not fixing the issue. Disappointed. This game is getting worse with every update ngl. I'm a fan but can't deny it's worthlessness.,3
"It's totally amazing game play i have seen in thie category. Graphics, animation or transition also good but i can't give you 5 star because it's take more and more storage compare to another which is really bad for me. If it work lite weight like 1.5 to 2.5gb max .",1
"This season update has ALOT of bugs, I'd be playing a ranked MP match and all of a sudden the sound vanishes, I play a BR and for some reason the door I followed into a building isn't there anymore, rather it's hidden by the wall animation....I really love this game so please let there be fixes soon",3
"This game sucks. It has so much lag, the users are abusive and there are features in game that just keep ruining the experience overall while in battle. The frame drops are heavy, you also face so many bad hit registrations, like you'll empty your guns and it'll still not make an impact. The ping is always unstable, whether you play on wifi or not.",1
"Fix your game, if I could I would rate half a star, once players begin to recognise what weapons are good and what is not so good, those good weapons of course are used, but it is quite unfair when the weapons kill speed is almost less than a second, so maybe for next season (season 4) I would HIGHLY recommend fixing your game over all else",1
It's the best mobile gaming app out there. Ads are optional. You don't have to pay anything for access to all weapons and maps ECT. It's so close to the console gaming and you can use an external controller.,5
"Very nice game overall is good, but there is something that annoys me so much and it is the sliding, it is like one slide equals to Marathon run the aim assist doesn't catch up the speed of the sliding, but please don't nerf it some much that it feels like a turtle. Thanks.",4
I have been playing this game for at least 2 years and was actually a very good experience and easy to play BUT for the last two seasons the game lags every time I try to play especially in BR and its not something wrong with my ping or device because it was working perfectly before so unless this is fixed I am uninstalling it from my device,2
"During a match, soon as I respawn and start moving, or at random times, the game will glitch and my character will blink back to where I started or in front of a wall. It does this about 3 times then stop for awhile and start again",3
used to play it with a ps4 controller but it stopped working so bought a normal Bluetooth controller. which works fine on my phone just discover that it won't work on cod so annoying. why I don't understand why you have to be so specific about controllers and I only found out when looking through the help section. please fix this issue you already have Bluetooth support just enable it for general codecs instead of only specific ones,2
"I absolutely love this game but now it won't ever start the game it lags, goes black screened, shuts my phone off and I can't even play it really at this point. I'm not giving up on call of duty but would like to see changes in the apps performance",1
Could always use more maps and better match making but overall not bad definitely enjoyable in some matches. Also u can shoot somebody 3 times with a sniper and they won't die but somehow you can get 1 shotted with a sniper and ranked doesn't mean anything if your good because more often then not your team isn't,2
Team we love this game but from past many months we are facing Lag and most importantly Frame drop issue. We are not able to playing smoothly. We have good and better configuration mobile for this game still we are facing Frame drop like anything.. Please look into the issue.,4
The game has become quite heavy. It takes about 10 mins to get to the main screen making me lose interest in playing. Also the game now lags a lot. My suggestion would be to focus more on the gaming experience than frequent updates.,1
"pls review the game love to play it but yeah the bugs make me so frustrated..Edit: can you pls change the way a tie works in capture the flag.. If we have more flags captured in the end it shouldn't be a tie we should win obviously.. pls fix Edit:pls fix the way the long shot obj works with shorty , after the nerf it is impossible to finish it.. Pls make the range req less Activision doesn't care about there games anymore Edit:fix ranked , don't want to play with bots.. there dumb",2
"Excellent and very well rounded in all aspects. Most of the lower ratings pertain to a specific aspects in the game; holistically it's unmatched and the best in Play Store. Thank you, developers, for this gem; the experience is mind blowing.",5
Excellent game. Unfortunately they are only concerned about your money and collecting as much of it as possible. They have no issues with hackers coming in and completely screwing up your game and kicking you offline in the middle of your match. That is not their concern they only care about you spending money on trying to get new weapons. It would be a great game if management gave half a s*** about anything other than money. Loved it. Would play it again if the people in charge managed to.....,2
"Awesome game! But I face some problems like teleportation, the traumatic sound of Chopper Gunner, and the sounds are badly optimized. What's even worse is that when I matchmake a Ranked Match, I play with noob teammates while the opponents are with pro teammates. Please fix this problem in the next update. Thank you.",5
"Game is a joke half the time ranks are not matched accordingly, 2 shots and your down but your bullets dont phase oppent half the time even with perks, cant see enemies in front of you biggest part of time. Needs a major over haul on playing exp cuz it has went down hill fast used to love playing it now not so much.",1
"the game doesn't even opens up, gets stuck at the loading screen and says no network connection, well im connected to wifi and all the other apps on my phone are working smooth like butter, found several users facing the exact same issue, and this issue is big, dear developera, please look into this.",2
"The only problem is this game takes more memory space ,in my phone it takes 7.1 GB space because it doesn't deletes the unwanted files and chache after the updation ,and one more thing is that this game required additional downloades like maps,HD audio, characters,guns blueprint,and comos etc. Try to solve this issue",4
"Why is there 2 battle royal maps & 9,999 multiplayer maps? Who has that much storage for a mobile game?!? This is beyond insane how much data you have to download & then more additional downloads after opening the game. This 1 application on my phone takes up all the storage. Keep making more useless items that nobody asked for, please. Like anyone has that much space on their mobile phone... There's way too many maps, & gun skins to keep track of, please fix your game! FIX THIS",1
"Error: ""Download configuration failed. Check internet connection. Or restart app"". I have been getting this annoying error from several days. My internet speed is fast enough for this game. Sometimes it works sometimes will not work even after switching networks and everything. Fix this please.",1
"Love the game! But please do a solo championship. Can do same game modes, but I have qualified for world championship 2 years in a row and never progressed because of having to find a team. I wanna know who the best player is in the world. Not who can find good people for a team.",5
"Used to be a great app. But once I updated to season 3 and logged in, my names been changed with no explanation, my friends list is 100% different, im a higher ranks than I was, and im in an entirely different clan. I am completely pissed off especially with all the money I've put into my account, just for it to be comply destroyed. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND Updated again and have the same problem! A completely different name and friends list. Different loadouts.",1
"I like how all multi-player cod games does this thing where as soon as you target an enemy a whole different enemy comes from nowhere behind you and kills you. ALL cod games have this problem. And you guys need to make it so the graphics will automatically adjust best for whatever device you have, shouldn't expect people to know what's the best settings for our devices",4
"This game is overall pretty good. However, if you have a low to medium end device, it sometimes becomes hell to play. The amount of mobile storage this takes up is crazy. Hopefully they do more optimization.",3
"I love the game, but it's not fair when some of the old players have some of the load outs that new players don't have access to. Like Swarm. Especially in the Rapid Fire servers, the old players would outmatch the new players and it's not fair at all. I think all of the weapons and such should be accessible instead of a season type thing",3
"This is so good! Before I downloaded this I thought it was going to be hard and it was but then I changed my settings and I'm a lot more better now, remember this game is not for EVERYONE it's for who enjoys it. Edit: Wait, this game had Zombies!? No wonder I felt like something is missing and I would really like to play it on call of Duty so please add it back even though I never tried. Edit 2: OMG THANK YOU SOME MUCH FOR ADDING ZOMBIES.",5
I have been playing this game since it came out and it had changed a lot. Back then I literally only played zombie mode now it's just to hard. Now I'm playing this game and every time I log in I remember literally everything... I will never get rid of those memories of me losing... to zombies,5
"This game is incredible it's very competitive and challenging to the extent that it requires real skill to become a good/great cod player, but despite that this game suffers so many glitches and it's just to annoying, not to mention the worser it gets upon every update. This game is great it the best FPS/TPS mobile game, but you guys still need to attend to those bugs",3
"No need to nerf presistence and hardline! In fact remove them. After playing for a long time, i have lost a lot of matches because other party was using persistence and hardline, sometimes losing matches by only two points because of the people using these two perks.",4
"First off, it takes a minute just to open the game, because of all the adds they throw in your face. But also, you can't get anywhere in the game. The higher you rank up, the less points you get each round, and the more you get penalized points when you lose. On top of that, I am pretty sure they add bots to the game. Because, at some point, it is impossible to do anything. Somehow, everyone become an expert shooter, and they all can somehow deal more damage than you. Play a good game, not this",1
"Love the game, but here lately I can't get through a single battle royal without the game glitching or completely shutting down all together..... Update...dropped my rating because the glitch issues were never fixed. Completely turns the game.",3
"Can you add this setting where you can transfer your account to another device. The only reason I'm asking is because when someone gets a new device and they download call of duty mobile on that new device the have to restart the whole game and they can't have there skins,weapons and score streaks from the other seasons, so please add this setting. You should add a movement where you can peak corners.",3
"As a fan of call of duty, i would like to suggest in multiplayer mood i think player running speed is too fast and sometime u cant even target on it. Need to low abit of running speed. I like to play mask man type guns. And over rank sniper aiming is really terrible 1 hit.",5
"The worst game you can play, 1- errors in graphics, errors in servers. 2- they put you in random servers, you can't choose. 3- you cannot play in ranked matches alone other than search and destroy, it takes a lot of time. 4-the ping goes up suddenly when shoting 5- when you report a hacker you will find him playing and is not blocked. 6- alot of people playing with aim bot and the support doesn't do anything about it Although i reported all this to the support and developer teams and no answer.",1
"Very fun fps although it is falling apart.The new update made the game alot laggier and the frames drop super bad although my wifi is strong.We need a South African server to fix most our problems.The amount of storage the game takes is unbelievable,its way to much.One good thing is that the game feels refreshing all the time with the frequent challenges to do and stuff to get is loads.after each update everything must be downloaded again wich is super annoying.With all that said,its still great",3
"there is a bug in the new update, it seems that some characters have there voice as the normal voce ( the black ops character (i think) overlayes on other characters), for me riggs and tengu rebar do not have there voices correct. hope you fix it .",2
"Coming up to the world championship, and I can't believe it takes so long for a controller player to find a ranked match. We used to be able to take our controller off and still get matches...now youve taken all the fun out of the game for me....I was looking forward to playing the championships and now, having timed out waiting for ranked matches, I don't see that happening. Last time I spend money on a game like I have this one.",1
"This game is quite full of hidden ads in it, concealed as ""mission briefing"" or alike. Somewhat bothering, but ok. But now it is abusing system notifications for sending annoying ads to you, even at times you are not playing it!!! Very bad practice, unacceptable! This should be banned!",1
"I am obsessed with this game. My friends and I play all the time and it keeps us entertained and helps us through the days struggles. Keep up the good work however, please be mindful of the space l/memory issue. It's important that anyone with a good enough smartphone can play this game because it's just so fun. Accessibility for everyone please and thank you.",5
This game needs more options to play dual on Frontline maps and in individual room maps. Plus this game needs more options for game gifts and power options for gun loadouts. However this is an AMAZING and AWESOME GAME. THANKS (CALL OF DUTY),5
"A fun free to play game. Plenty if rotating game modes and if your into group play, the clan wars have a fun set of rotating mission options also. The only reason I'm not giving this game a 5 star review is because of the odd balancing of the skill based matchmaking. But all in all I'd recommend downloading this game and giving it a try.",4
"Too many cheaters and hackers on this game and you developers have not figure out how to stop that. It kills the fun out of the game. Another thing I'm discovering that the developers seems to favor people who coin, your controls don't work for you all of a sudden functions like if you're pulling backwards the hide from the enemy all of a sudden you notice your players moving forward so you can get shot.",1
"Love the game and don't have anything to complain about but I would like to see an option for us to be able to choose not to play with people that are using controllers I mean this is a Mobile game meant to be played on the phone using the phones controls and that's it. And yes I know people will probably tell me if I don't like it don't play, well I'm still going to play and enjoy the game because even with then using controllers I'm still kicking as* and taking names haha",5
"This game SUCKS, and 4ever WILL. The matching system is BULLCRAP. NOTHING WILL EVER change. The same G.Damn nightmare EVERY season. The ""optimizations"" fix 1 thing and ruin a 100K others. That's Bullshitization. 1 star is way too much. This game will NEVER be what it once was, NO MATTER how hard you try. I hope Blizzard makes drastic changes to ""try"" to fix the unfixable. Or else, they will regret wasting that kind of money. A never-ending and non-fixable disgrace.",1
"They should be optimizing the game more for people who play in mid and low spec devices, rather than bringing new in-game items to sell. It's just really frustrating to play with all the lags and glitches all the time.",2
"I like the game, i didn't think mobile gaming could be this good until this game. After the last update it s slow, my ping is good, i don t think my phone is the problem, it ran just fine until now. Can't play it any more, i get frame drops and can't get even close to 60 fps. Not playble...",2
"Ive been playing this game since i can remember, but this season is absolutely horrible, everyone's sound crashes mid game, its always lagging please fix it more and more people are going to apex cause there is stuff u guys dont fix, fix this problems please the sound leaving makes everyone loose and its starting to become a problem. No Activision i dont know this game like this. It makes me sad, all we wanna do is come home and play the game then this happens and it just makes our day worse.",2
Ranked matches are rigged or bugged? Not sure how in ranked people always end up outshooting you despite you hitting them first way in advance and you end up dying. Not to mention that lots of time people opponents health aren't even reduced despite multiple shots are accurate and that you have emptied half a clip on. People are using emulators and controllers which are giving insane advantages as certain movements are restricted playing on mobile.,1
Kills doesn't add up. It is frustrating to play. Please look at this matter. This happens all the time. It makes us feel like not playing at all. Kills count are random which is providing a bad game experience.,1
"Overall game experience is great, but communication with friends while playing keeps disconnecting due to game design, Comms should not be cut off we end up always miscommunicating. Also if we switch to what'sap for quick audio msg comms no longer work.",4
Very laggy due to this game forcing my phone to disconnect from wifi so I have to turn wifi off to play. Much larger game than I think is necessary. This game's support is a joke. If you get a real agent the agent doesn't know what he or she is doing and responds with the wrong info. For instance I asked about using just my Twitter profile pic and the agent said FB instead. I pointed that out and he asked for a screenshot of my settings like he did nothing wrong.,2
"I like this game very addictive, that being said, it would be awesome if they made the walls and other structures to be torn down by bullets and grenades. As far as the zombies original one was way better. They should introduce it on this platform. I don't think they realize how many people would really like to play it with all the new weapons.. overall great game play.",5
It's call of duty all the same. Typical bs that goes on. For some reason devs for CoD games think it's necessary to make spawn camping a real thing. Good luck ever getting that to go down in Battlefield. Just saying this game is trash. Even being an elite 5 this game is trash. Every map is the se everytime cuz trash ayers like to spawn camp. Legit only play if you can handle getting shot by snipers as soon as you spawn. Also the hit boxes are complete trash!,2
Often gets disconnected despite live internet connection. Also.. It doesn't start nowadays with reason there is I internet connection. (While I am using other streaming applications same time without any problem). Please resolve the issue. It's appearing after new downloads since almost last week. Also every time I have to play. Why should I download some updates? Everytime? It's punishment. Please address immediately.,2
"COD is great game but the only and the most irritating issue of this game that it is not balanced. Some guns are completely overpowed and no matter how much skilled u are, u will die to them and few guns are way too bad that it seems like a water gun. This is not the story of only one season. This issue is in the game since the its release and just because of this we can not use our fav guns in ranked for its too bad if compared to the meta guns.",1
4/22/22 update. 1 STAR from 5 star.. LAGGGG.. Premium players get server priority. I understand everyone lags sometimes.. But not the premium customers with the fancy special fx killing you through 2 walls $h!t.. Back to how it was... Best game ive played on my phone. Stylo 6/ i had a samsung note which made gameplay much better. You need a Nice! Phone w the ram n cpu speed to avoid choppy play. Free to play and battle royale is the best! Glitches in BR mode when enemies approach sometimes..,1
It is a good game just need to fix the glitching problem my wifi runs 23 ms but then I run to fast or get Into a car it instantly runs 150ms then crashes and if it was suitable for Android so i could see skins and not have to lower my graphics to play that would be awesome but other them that it is a good game,3
"Great game but such a lack of game development its like the devs dont want to change the core gameplay or the style that is in bo4 and bo3? Not sure but things like spawns in hardpoint and domination are terrible, why are domination sites in terrible locations, whereas in cold war its done so well. I feel like as this game is a triple a that has such great games even this mobile game should be up to the standards of other call of duty games. And add the pellington pleaseeee",4
"Great work on the game from the creator this is literally the best game ever. I have something I still need to say about it though ""when going for draws with CP and duplicated item are converted to just coin its unreasonable for something I purchased with money and all I get for a duplicate is just a coin why give duplicate at all if that's what it would be converted into? On that aspect it's so unfair please this should be considered. Outside this its generally the best mobile game ever",5
The game isn't loading after the new update. It isn't going past the introduction screen and keeps showing the message TIME OUT. That needs to be fixed.,1
"Used to be a absolute Brilliant game, but after so many years the battle royal is just full of ai's (bots) I played a game of battle royal and there was 8 real people out of 100 in the match. Multiplayer is just full of hackers now every ones using auto aim auto fire is. Typical call of duty game Brilliant for about the first year then the hacks come along now it's a dead game",1
It's a great first person shooter for your phone I enjoy playing it a lot and like the fact that they use stages from modern war fare and black ops is like to see them put jungle in this mobile version of call of duty it would be awesome,5
"The game is good , but it gets laggyer everytime they update, although my phone is also a cause, but for the buying mythic mistry lucky draw seasonal guns you must spend at least 100 to 200‚Ç¨ to get the gun which is too much and stupid. I spend till 55‚Ç¨ and didn't get it, so will never spend ‚Ç¨1 more for that crab",4
"Game could be fun but sadly the one map with a tiny map and playing hardpoint is terrible for a game mode. Plus you get spawn camped every second you spawn. 2 star rating for this dumb game, oh yeah final one ""zombies"" what is this zombies game mode? Is dumb to survive days and repair stuff...this game is boring and dead",2
The new update seems buggy again. I tested graphics styles in BR but it seems like developers have removed graphic optimizations for low end devices done in season 1 The hiest update! This has increased the lag which is misery! I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A BUG,3
Hello cod developers I want to tell that I love this game but this game have one issue. See I don't want to tell you this but this makes the game unplayable. You see that melee weapon does 200 damage which means that can one shot players . Can you decrease the damage of melee weapon from 200 to 100 damge. By the way love this game so much. üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèº,5
I submitted a ticket about not being able to see the daily quest and can not collect the mission prizes all PG said was do a forced stop reset so I did and still can't see the daily missions. 2 months this has been going on. I have a Samsung s21 5g. People that have IPhones aren't experiencing this. Maybe that will help Pg fix it!! 4 yr. Member.,3
"Overall this game is nice but it takes so much net connection and I can't even play an mp ranked match due to this problem . I hope codm Dev's will solve this issue and this game contains crashes, lag and net problems. NOW after season 5 update 2022 , there is login bug which says login timeout which is literally annoying üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò°üò° Makes me RAGE!! So MUCH!! OG CODM Was Actually better than this one . Now Apex Legends Mobile and Minecraft Is Way BETTER That THIS GAME!!",1
"Developers did a hell of a job here! Great graphics, breakthrough gameplay and most of all smooth running servers. I really hope that it dont end up a "" pay to win"" game.",5
"Unplayable garbage. PC gameloop players mixed up with mobile players. Tons of cheaters. Jumping, aiming, crouching, sliding shooting in the same time. You empty a mag on them and nothing, they shoot one or two and you are dead. Spawn locations right in front of opponents. They should pay players to play this bs game",1
One of the only games l enjoy playing. Great game! Easy to use in Controls and tons of options in weapons. Upgrading and leveling up is awesome. I only wish you could continue leveling up higher than 150 but still love it.,5
"This game is really cool to play on. Especially for boys who like shooting games. I like playing with my family alot and we enjoy playing almost every day. Everytime my parents say, ""hop on"", I always know it's call of duty, but, I had to get a new phone just to get more space on the one I have now, because it takes up SO MUCH SPACE that I have to get even a new phone for. If you want this app, you have to have a lot of space! Otherwise, I recommend this app!!!",4
Please seperate vehicle sound from foot steps sound in setttings both increase when i want to increase only footstep sound. Main problem:- i keep sfx volume full (high) so i could clearly hear footstep sound but it increases vehicle sound too (both included in sfx) and when i am in vehicle or plane during entry in battle royale i could not hear voice chat sound. Plz solve it üôÑ,1
The game is nice and awesome. The graphics is too cool. But u wont get that much of an enviornment as u get in pubg in classic mode. The multiplayer mode is unmatched and great. The only problem i find with the game is that u need good spec phone to support the graphics.,4
"Its good, I do wish they had an option for the old zombies mode where it was like how it is on the console games because a lot of people found that more fun, now in the new mode you just have to deal with an overwhelming swarm of enemies, your teammates stealing your supplies, and the tasks for you to get rewards being impossible, I also wish they had more of a variety for modes instead of the traditional 4 and at most 4 other ones at a time. Lag is also a huge issue. TLDR game needs work",4
It's hand's down honestly the best game on Google Play although I do have one neggative thing to say whitch is that the online purchases cost way to much & I understand that the game is free & the developers need to get some sorda funding for there time but really come on you guy's charged me close to $200 just to unlock 1 skin with a gun it's bu**s**t im not rich! But Thank You to the Developers for such a beautiful game experience possible you guy's are awesome for that just go easy on us oküëå,4
If you decide to download a game suck as this kind then I can say Ull never get bored of playing... The graphics and built game quality with literally everything overall is the best!! .... U don't feel the need for a play station or xbox.... So yeah Ull always want to play this game basically N forget all the stats for now When ur bored...hipe.... sad....angry....happy...sometimes busy ull hop on this game Basically it's a good game to play and ull want to keep it around in your phone. KB‚úå,5
"Edit yes still free to play and even more hackers and people cheating. This update is so bad lots of lagging, people disconnecting during a match. I would have love to have made a purchase but to many bugs, hackers and cheaters to enjoy the game. Edited, nothing has changed even WORSE than before. If you could get even WORSE this game has found a way to do it.",1
So the game itself is great brilliant graphics only a few thing that are annoying. 1 is the cheating players not many but come across it a few times now and 2 is the size of the game now it's now just over 12gb which is not a big problem for my phone can't understand why it has to be so big has to be a limit to its size when I first installed the game it was 4gb in size.,4
Decent enough now that the bugs are gone. Question where are my two 99¬¢ packs it just a gray space in my inventory that just says two!! Uh a little help here would be nice. There are too many kids on the game now. I don't even want to play they don't understand the concept of the game.,2
"This is my favourite game. But I don't know what happened after I installed the recent updates. Whenever I play any BR and MP, the screen goes black. I have to restart the game, and in between someone pulls the trigger. I have even played in the lowest graphics, still the problem persists. I have 8 GB RAM and Snapdragon 720G. I am not uninstalling it and will definitely inform the same to my buddies. Edit: the above problem is gone now. Thank you.",5
I Love this game i am having in the pc all of the call of duty games ........ i am having tab first I went to multiplayer the graphics is ok like always I play but in the BR the graphics of very high and frame rate medium but graphics like low I thought it was bug First person the graphics are very low so i went 3rd peron the same bug in that alsoüòë‚òπÔ∏èso i went more matches the same bug or glitch so can please fix this bug in the next update if u readyed I will give 5stars plz........,1
Correcting myself from my previous review. Upgraded my phone to more ram and space . /Not for the game .just cos I needed a new phone/ The game works absolutely flawless now and I'm enjoying to the full. No lags or any issue . Truly my favourite game,5
"The game is amazing I only have a few requests, can you add more pistols and could yall also put akimbo on all other guns you'd usually put on, another thing can yall make it to where you can choose what you want to hide or show on the guns please, and add overkill PLEASE I'm begging you it would be so fun and amazing to have again plus add riot shields",4
"The game is Banging but I get thrown into games that are about end alot of time, For example if I play Frontline and click start, either team would have gotten 30/50kills. It's so annoying especially when the team you are on is losing",3
I mean call of duty is a wonderful game because it's from the call of duty franchise but it doesn't work on low end devices properly and the new ground war mode lags a lot and the Indian server gets a lot of ping spikes. And our f2p community doesn't have a lot of options I think that it would be really cool to add co in large events too aur set up events of battle pass activation cards atleast.,4
They are doing match fixing when ever we are killing a system player everything fine but when we are firing on real player game is like stuck empty the whole magazine on the enemy still not a single bullet hurt him. And same time game run like a video and in very slow motion player speed also goes down. If guy you want us to be üêê goat then this is not fare let us know we will play something else rather than this game,1
"Past issues were fixed with update however I'm finding the game won't always load up.....well I thought past issues were fixed however 8ve had to download the new map 3 times, the game closes for no apparent reason and takes 10-15 minutes to load or gets stuck on the initializing dynamic download resources",1
This game has become a rull on pay to win. Before the players who didn't pay had a chance to win at least. But now it's just impossible. It's like we are playing for the paying gamers to score more. Really disappointed. Now it's better to uninstall this game.,1
Definitely good although the zombies aren't original it is still good except the feature that it would take several years just to get a skin for your character or even to be able to even get that much cod points or whatever the other coins are but its hard to get ski s thank you,5
Very frustrating not having the option to skip those stupid mandatory tutorials. I'm a veteran who's been playing this game since it first came out. Now everytime I try to login as a guest I'm required to complete the whole damn tutorial before olayingan actual match. Why isn't there an option to skip the tutorials?,1
"I've stuck with this game ever since it came out, but now all the damn game does is lagg me out of matches and it takes to much storage,(14.9GB) and after awhile the phone starts to over heat and then the frames drop. It pains me to give this game 3 stars, I held this game up with high regards, but now it has fallen from grace. And somehow I'm getting bot lobbies in master rank. Which signifies the game is dying, I will be switching over to apex Mobile shortly.",3
"it's enjoyable to an extent then you have the people that always slide and shoot through the walls, like unless you see someone duck beside the window or hide right inside the door, how do you know where they are, I have people snipe me through the walls and I haven't left the building or gave any indication where I was, that's the only unenjoyable part of the game other then that I've enjoyed it, the zombiesode isn't enjoyable it sucks bc it's not round based like the old ones bring back rounds",4
"Beginning to seem like there's to many hackers to the game playing it continuously running into people that jump way too high, sprint at speeds to high to keep up with and apparently don't even have to aim with the way they can come around corners already knowing your there and shooting you instantly its starting to ruin the fun of the game when you keep getting into games with 3 or 4 players doing this stuff",1
I love the game. I've been a cod fan is the very beginning. The only thing they left out was the perk to carry 2 main guns and extra options on the gun itself. The game plays well so yeah I got nothing bad to say about it. Good job. And we'll done.,4
It'd be nice if there is a feature to clear redundant files in the game. I havent downloaded all maps but it already occupied 11GB of my phone storage which is a big issue as mobile phones doesnt have large storage capacity as compared to PC.,3
"Fantastic game! Incredibly good graphics for a mobile game!! After you download all of the ""resource packs"" (free, High quality audio, character textures, maps, etc). Very fun game! Highly recommend!",5
"This matching on this sucks, I'm level 38 or something close to that and I'm going up against level 150 people. That needs to be fixed because it no fun when a guy runs around with a mega overpowered melee weapon and destroys you entire team in .2 seconds. But I will say it was very fun when I was playing against people that matched my skill set.",3
"Four stars cuz I just love the game. Minus a star cuz I can't play the tournament mode, it keeps saying season unavailable for some reason and I've went to it a the time it says it opens on Sunday Saturday and Friday but it keeps saying the same thing season unavailable if yall could help me resolve this issue I'll I'll that last star",4
"The game is good but the process of logging in is terrible, I had an account that I spent money in and was ranked high. But after this recent update I'm unable to log in to my original account which is linked to my Google account. They want you to use Facebook or some other social media I don't care to have. Now the app is forcing me to create a new account. They just take ypur money and don't help. I'm okay I'll just try apex legends and spend my money with them. Thanks Activision üñïüèΩ",1
"Game is good but the lag issue and sudden frame drops that i am facing is unbearable, i love this game...this game was playable even in potato devices at start without lag but after two seasons its totally unplayable even in mid range phones... fix the game and the size since its almost 12 gb now..after five or six updates may be i think it will turn into 50 gb...",2
First of all I am having codm from 3 yrs and in old days it was really good game but with the passage of time its ingame features are improving but the smoothness of the game is reducing day by day.frequent lags and crash issues are common now a days even my device specs are also increased with them crashes are also increased please fix this. How ever I want to suggest three things: 1.the feature of fire button should be like that as we press the button along with going in ADS firing should also,4
"I've been playing for 3 years and this has been the best stress buster. However, lately I find it difficult to login and many a times it's impossible to get through. Hopefully the developers fix this asap.",3
"After almost 4 years, I have been playing this game from launch day, I am changing my review from a 5 star to a 1 star. I cannot go below 1 star. The main reason is After spending thousands of dollars and more thousands of gaming hours my account got hacked. Activision customer service was so bad that After 3 weeks of trying to get help I gave up. My Facebook and PSN accounts are frozen (linked) with the original COD Mobile account. I cannot release them. Disappointing customer support .",1
"I'm facing a login problem now. I don't know how to solve the problem. I think It's all happened after the new update.. Auto login is not working, and it's keep showing ""network problem"" . But all other apps are working fine .. Expecting Help . Please solve this problem.",2
"It was honestly 100% not pay to play until a few new epic guns came out. I'm now a casual player after spending way too much money. They ruined the game with built in sights, and perks for spending cash",2
"I wanna give zero stars so bad. Its fun at first and then it's just teribble. Everyone is using the same weapons that don't need skill to use and they're always adding new weapons making the game very unbalanced. people can walk around with knives and a lot of absurd stuff that shouldn't be in an shooter game As soon as someone appears from behind, your dead and persistent users make my phone lagging because of the spamming of scorestreaks. Too hard when you're at Grandmaster rank.",1
"Love this game! Only one issue, it gives the option to connect your profile to Google, but it doesn't work & only allows you to connect with Facebook, which sucks for the ppl who don't have Facebook lol",4
Been playing fine up until today. Playing undead. And literally keeps putting the guys behind me as first dead or literally starting me off as dead. Tried 4 matches in a row. Had to quit the game after attempting to play for a half hour. What's the point if you take away my abilities. Have fun thinking you won something. The good players get screwed. Hense pointless and a waste of my lunch break may as well throw the game away until the clan wars starts again,1
Been playing call of duty for years and it never gets old! What I love the most is that you don't have to spend money to advance in the game. It would be nice if the prices to buy credits/bundles were a bit cheaper other than that the game is awesome.,4
Hi Activision. I liked this game a lot and I played it very well. But just one thing that can make the game better is: Please add isolated map also in undead siege mode. And also please add an air force Base in blackout so that we can get fighter aircrafts also like in warzone,5
Very good game but the attractive characters are needed to be purchased which disappoints most of the players... Need some rectification. I guess there is glitch like there is no friends option in microphone option both in mp Or br mode. Very disappointed.. Urgent rectification required.,5
The BEST mobile gaming ive ever came across...graphics are lit..gameplay controls are too good...weapons pretty accurate with the real thing plus very competitive players from all over...storage is pretty massive as expected...data consuming is normal..different mp and br modes which is pretty exciting...by far no other mobile game has come near codmobile,5
Improve you bots pls it takes from the experience and thrill!!! Overall this game is perfect and free but I do buy here and there I do really miss were it was easier to snipe it just all changed then you lost a lot of regular people that play bring that back then you have more people playing in my opinion there were barley any bots in br maybe 3 then that update then from there on more and more bots,5
The game is wonderful the only problem I have with it is it keeps playing certain boards over and over and over again when there is plenty of maps to randomize and play the variety or majority of maps that's on here that's downloaded to my phone there's some maps I have not even seen yet only when I downloaded them but overall I love the game,4
"It perfect, this mobile game has been my main for months I don't think it will change anytime soon. Edit: While being a low end device player, I personally aswell as other low end device players really need optimization in the game. So if you decide to place such a setting I know many will decide to join the codm community, Just a opinion.",5
Love this game!!! But some people don't have credit cards to purchase CP so I think it should have other methods of making purchases for the game especially for the legendary weapon lucky draw. However best combat game ever!!,5
This game is real good I love everything about it the graphics and so on but before it will get a five star the lagging of this game is to much and something must be done about it and also there are sometimes i need to download all maps and weapon and some other things in the game that are needed to be downloaded again which is data consuming something should be done please if that is fix cod gets five stars,3
"My only complain to CODM is that in the 'snipers only' mode, there should be a variety of snipers to choose from (even your own custom sniper) as we can only choose between 2 snipers and nothing else. There is no way that everyone is going to use the same snipers in a real match. So I hope that the developers see this and think about adding more snipers to the 'snipers only' mode. Everyone who sees this comment pls like it ao that it can be seen by the developers.",4
"This game is awesome, but the game need an optimize because sometimes before I throw a grenade the game freeze for a short or a longer time (I think this is even worse on low-end devices), and also there is a bug that remove you weapon sight, this bug actually happened to me on a sniper weapon (maybe outlaw and a lot on M13) so just want this game to be more optimized in the future",5
What happened??? where tf is my account?? Yesterday game wasn't loading so I deleted it and installed again. Today managed to update but when I try to log into the cod it first made me to reset my password and then is telling me to create a username! When I put my usual one it says its in USE! FIX IT!!!!!! Edited. So I resumed playing my rookie account. And it doesn't give me what I earn! No way to contact cod team. I'm pissed off and if I wouldn't like the game I'd delete it for ever.,1
"The gameplay itself is decent. However, the sheer amount of hackers and mod users is attrocious once you level up in rank. The higher you get, the more bs you encounter with this. Activision has long had a problem with allowing such activity on their platforms and I would like to see something done about it. Maybe introduce an A.I based server monitoring system that detects such activity and sets penalties on the players responsible.",3
"Hi, i have been playing this game for 2 years now and i want to complain about the tournament mode, i appreciate the effort of giving out free cp and animated gunskins but the free for all mode is too stressful and not fun to play at all, the gunfight mode was yet fun to play but free for all just made me delete your game. Theres too much of third party, camping and k9 unit spawns which doesnt make it a fun process. I hope to see a better mode next weekend",1
This is a great free game if you want to pass the time. You dont have to buy anything if you dont want to. Lot of diffrent game choices to keep you busy. Would recommend to everyone that likes this type of shooting game.,5
"Update 5/31/2022: I downloaded the game again in 2022. I was enjoying undead siege, been playing it for a while, my favorite mode. New season 5 update is here and they decided to take away zombies, my favorite game mode. New update is utter trash, rating it 1 star because I can't give no stars, no more zombies. Developers, please bring back zombies, thank you. Update 6/1/2022 uninstalled the game.",1
"I'm giving this a two star rating because of the stupid bug that keeps happening daily and the bug is that when I'm about to win a battle royale game it takes me out of the game and when I restart it, it says you have no internet access. Activision fix ths damn bug please!",2
This reminds me of playing Socom 3: Combined Assault in the PS2 era days. There needs to be team deathmatch but no respawn. Low weapons damage and high health would work well. And the ability to do third person matches would be awesome as well.,5
"Ok Activision it's s good game but I have a low end divice and when I play ranked some explosion could crash my game. When I log back into the game it says I'm band for 5 mins for leaving... I didn't ment to leave, and also my ranked exp goes down when it's not my fault... please fix ranked so that if your game crashes you won't lose process.. I can't even make it to pro III do to game crashes and losing progress from that.",5
"I've recently got the game again and I've already ran into issues, it keeps on telling me that I have an ""unstable internet connection"" or ""check your connection"" when I have a brand new phone and full bars on 5g network, and it just ends up kicking me out of the matches cause I can't even play, I don't know if it's just my phone or the personal CoD servers but if its the servers can y'all please check it cause I really wanna play again",2
"I'm hopeless with this game now, I used to play this game long time, it was better, now I'm sad to say that it's the worst game, alot of bugs, just alot. To developer: you guys are not fixing those anyway, you should fox those bugs rather than new fancy updates. I'm not paying this game few days, I gave it a try today and lost hope again. Server issues üòì",1
"It's a great game, good controls and graphics. My only complaint would be how much space it takes up, I agree with other people saying that there should be an option to uninstall certain things they don't use.",4
"I love mobile games because I can't afford to get a PC but in regards to this specific game I radder play it on mobile, because it was built perfectly. Thanks COD Mobile for the hard work. Job well done üëè.",5
"The new update is disappointing. The game always shows network error, the events section doesn't load at all. The gameplay hasn't improved since the first time the game was released. Update- the game doesn't even load up, it takes 10 min and it shows 'timout'. Uninstalling because it's annoyingüò°.",1
"Fun game with great graphics. The matchmaking needs work though, should be done by levels not rank, I'm a level 70 and I'm always against level 150 players in BR, makes the game quite frustrating.",4
Stop making the game bigger. I'm now going to have to purchase another device to play. Some how even the playing field out even with high price internet I'm still running at 70-120ms and playing with and against people with 20 ms. I know it's got to update but 13 gb is to much on a phone. New map for br would be great. And buy back or self revive and gas masks would be great as well. Only reasons I gave 3 stars and not 5 was the Ms or lag and the size.,3
"The only mobile game I haven't uninstalled because how boring it is. Can't wait to see more guns, knives, and etc. and more skins and characters and the option to customize characters.",5
Excellent üí™üí™üí™ great game I have it on Android and Apple and must say apple version is a lot better in every. Can be a bit glitchy at times and yes I have gone through a few screen protectors now as you do get just a little upset when a team member in br mode decides to go for dinner halfway through a match and leaves his team's tags just waiting ü§Ø,5
"Super fun game, it takes a LOT of storage in your phone and if you do not have enough storage the game will not work, it'll lag or will not let you play for long. Other then that they keep up with trends, holidays, you can connect with friends and play, very strict on swearing over mics, keeps the game clean, once you move up levels the people get better and better as opponents. My least favorite part will be that the zombies isn't like the original zombies on Xbox, or anything else.",5
"I have played for over 2 years. So far my experience has been very good. I was impressed from the start by the overall quality of the game. This feels like a part of the franchise, not just a 3rd party spinoff. The controls are excellent, graphics crisp and detailed, and not to mention it runs amazing. The servers are stable and it uses very little data (8-10mb/round) I can't distinguish between wifi and cell when I'm playing. No bugs or complaints phones used: moto g5s+, s9+, s21 ultra. 10/10",5
"Everything is amazing! Only drawback is that if you want the coolest skins, you have to really dish out some money for those. Also, for a long time now, every time BR Alcatraz is available, there's insane amounts of glitches and bugs. I imagine it will be fixed this year but it has been quite some time with a lot of updates big and small with no noticeable corrections made to that map. Still 5 stars because bugs, glitches, call of fashion, etc etc I'm still a dedicated player. Activision, fix BR",5
"Great game, it's what you'd expect from Call Of Duty. I have one complaint though that I've experienced persistently across THREE Android versions (9, 10, and now 11). The notification bar randomly turns gray and remains at the top of the screen indefinitely until the game is completely closed (using the system app menu), which obstructs all buttons and info there. This is the only persistent complaint I have, otherwise, good stuff.",4
"Earlier I gave you three stars, but now I'm forced to change that to one. This game sucks. It sucks real time. Zero customer support, lagging game on a strong connection, opponents are like hackers who can control the environment, unfair respawns, biased updates, what not. I have been playing this game since 2020, and let me tell you, they are getting worse by the day and each update is a worst copy of the previous. This game is no good. Don't believe the top rated reviews. Thanks.",1
"Great gameplay, I love Battle Royale, but there are some glitches: 1. When loading, it sometimes gets stuck on the Terms and Conditions/Facebook Login page and won't load any further. I've just had to uninstall it and reinstall but it's refusing to install now. 2. Occasionally, despite having an enemy in your crosshairs and your gun being fully loaded, it doesn't fire, resulting in you getting killed. 3. There must be some cheating going on as some players are seemingly indestructible.",4
Almost a perfect game.... There's nothing really to critique about except some minor bugs and glitches. This game is best for mobile devices available at the time in my opinion. Even at the lowest graphics settings it looks better than many of it's competitors highest graphics possible. It has many maps and gun and its customisation options to try. Game doesn't disappoints in providing a sense of realism. Facing a ping issue is very rare in this game for me. Definitely recommended. A must play..,4
"It is indeed an excellent game for a mobile version and a true effort is made to keep it exciting and fresh. However, also being from South Africa, I have to agree with other SA players that we fall behind in terms of ping. It is a fast paced game which needs an excellent ping to play competitively with those in other countries. It is a big frustration losing one-on-one fights all the time. We really need an African server and the option to play against local players for us to compete.",4
This game is very fun for me. but the reason I'm giving this game 4 stars Is whenever i play ranked matches this game kicks me out because of some kind of black screen glitch i have a good phone so i don't think this is a lag or something i try to clear the data and download again but that doesn't work pls fix this hehe.,4
I don't understand why they can't just bring back the old zombies mode it was more fun and not impossible. There's a difference between a challenge and a struggle. This zombies mode it's just a pain to keep the base health up and you can't fix it in time or else you'll get swarmed and killed. Absolutely trashed. They killed the game and massacred it so bad,1
"I love this mobil game it's a great time killer. Really easy to get hooked on but one bit of criticism tho the different camouflage 4 the guns and player r large but I personally would prefer the ability 2 customis my character camo colors 4 guns and character. I'm a neon green and black color user or blue,green,and black.",4
I think it's the best inside the Battle Royale game but sometimes there are a lot of problems. Most of the time there is a time out. Which turns out to be very annoying. Hopefully activation will solve this problem,5
"The new season is keeping the game slow, lot of glitch and frames get stuck lot of times. Please do something to keep the game going flawless. Previous season was way too good.",3
"At first it was awesome, now is so many glitches bugs and freezes up in the game it's not even enjoyable no more. I think y'all need to do better for real for real cuz I invested a lot of money in this game free to be playing like trash!!!",2
COD MOBILE Deserves 5 star for multiplayer. Make the multiplayer ranked mode more smooth. I hope you understand. Theres a lot of low end device player. So please make it run on low specs too. Everly low end device player would love it if you make it smooth and run without lag.,4
"Every update it's the same stuff. Game starts taking forever to load, it starts lagging a lot more than usual, and it starts crashing even on ranked matches making it harder to rank.",1
"I like this game a lot, but it fries my phone everytime i hop into ranked domination or hardpoint because of all the tacticals, lethals and scorestreaks spammers. And this is made possible by 2 perks - Persistence and Hardline. Please nerf these 2 perks, And I'm saying this from all the low-end device players because it lags and crashes our game. BTW, I like how you haved nerfed katana and buffed so many old guns! Keep it up!",4
"Game is very good but when the update is released, you have to download many things. Its already occupying 14.58 gb in my phone. I dont know for how long i will be able to run it on my phone. If you wanna play this game, buy a separate high spec phone. The size of it is increasing day by day. Soon it will become a 20gb game. Activision, keep the limited characters, weapon skins & maps available to use every season. Remove the rest skins from players data but save them so they can use afterwards.",1
"I appreciate how you guys have made this game better, but I would still like to know why I can't play on high graphics??? I have 8gig ram, I just bought the new nova 8 and I can't play the game on high graphics, please see onto the issue... And also if there is something that I would like to add is the sound in warzone when your bullets hits an enemy I love that sound",5
"The game is good. I just got a new phone not too long ago and everytime I download maps or weapons, the game quits on me. I really want them to download and not quit on me too so I can play. Really not happy about this and had to delete almost all of my apps on my phone and still can't get them downloaded.",3
"Thanks for bringing high quality audio back, now please fix the extremely long load times. It's almost unusable when you're just trying to load one quick game. Load time is painful.",3
"Great game but it closes/crashes way too much. I'm considering never playing it again unless this issue is fixed soon! I can't get through an entire match without the app closing and it's very frustrating. I just cleared all memory and cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it seems like it got worse.",1
I love the graphics and the friends I have made in this game. I do have a question out of desperation please. My account is REDSOXKILLER and I accidentally deleted the app and reinstalled it. I was logged in as guest and should've either used COD or Facebook. Is there any possible way to get access to my token so I don't end up losing my progress?,5
"I just discovered cod on Mobile like a week ago, but it's so good I've probably played a years worth of games in that time. I had serious doubts that they would be able to mimic the gameplay of console, but they do, and it's impressive. With other games I've had major issues controlling the touch screen, but with codm it's so smooth. I've almost had more fun playing it on mobile then I ever did on console.",5
"I am having lag issue during gameplay . I am using infinix zero x neo . During game play my player moves normally but the rest of the players stops . and then after 3-5 seconds the scenes loads and players starts moving again . It seems to be delay in game play like delay from server end . Please help me. I tried al the setting low graphics , faster frame rate but the server keeps lagging .",1
Awesome game. They brought old maps from old cod games. The old versions seemed to be more skilled base and now seem to allow spamming of streaks and equipment. Please make the game more competitive and bring back the OG Zombies.,4
"Id give this a 5 star but the stupid game crashes and blacks out so much. Its so devastating and i just want to throw/break something when it happens. Its unplayable. This not for me only, apparently this is happing on all devices and its a game software issue. Hopefully these stupid things are gonna vanish in season 4.otherwise goodbye ""COD"" üôÑüôÑüôÑ",1
Nothing loads into the screen like my guns amo an health pack don't show up can't see anyone from a distance or some times until it's to late. Also the game crashes in the first 2 mins very disappointed takes to long to load and single players have to wait forever to find a match,1
"This game is sooo perfect,it is also controller compatible. Something i do really want is maps that are just like the ones from the actual game.",5
Controller support does not work . The controller connects fine to my tablet galaxy tab s8 ultra via Bluetooth . I've tried using the ps5 controller and the moga xp5 x plus controller nothing works... Update .. so the latest update added support for the ps5 controller but the right analogue stick does not work . Can you please fix it ASAP!,1
"Over 2 years later. Still no African server. No Africa-based players allowed in the World Championship. Has definitely become more of a fashion parade than anything else. Still playing, but rarely now and only for a few minutes at a time. It was glorious.",3
I really like this game its really fun and once you play it its hard to get off i really would reccomend this game if your a person who loves shooting games like me but there is one promblem that is when you are playing on moble sometimes it will put you up to an controller player whitch ruines the game so ya theres a little problems with the game but overall it is a really fun game to play with friends or without friends.,4
"Great app, love the shooting. The new mac is rigged but apart from that AND THE SO CALLED ""LUCKY"" DRAW the game is awesome. Really stop giving me stupid stuff on the lucky draws, i always get the glider the camo for the bomb a parachute and then after that i finally get stuff. Rigged af Also the prices are weird like in game it says 9.99 but the pack is actually 10.99 bcs of the tax Weird",3
"Still has glitches. If I try to use a sniper scope, my whole app minimizes and it takes a few seconds to bring it back up. I died once. The biggest problem is how stupid and unrealistic this is. All the gurus who spend 100 bucks to get top secret grade munitions and outfits that look like clowns... ruin the game. Seriously. I'll probably delete it again. Waste of time. I'll spend a half hour gathering gear only to be killed in one second by an ""air raid"" from a literal clown with a super gun.",1
Would give 0 stars if possible. Spent years playing and enjoying this game. Then my account got hacked. Support was completely useless at helping me get it back. While playing I had spent allot which I was happy to do but after not being able to get my account back the person who hacked it got my account banned for 10 years. Would not recommend. Customer support is non existent.,1
"I had uninstalled the app for a few months and reinstalled it few days back. Now whenever I start it, it shows that the device has no active internet connection, when I am working on a stable wifi connection. I dont understand what the problem is.",1
Truly amazing. Even better than PUBG. Using on S22 Ultra/Exynos. No issues. Smooth gameplay and great frame rate and graphics. Edit: Changed to 4 stars as the app has shut down a few times while in battle royal.,4
I love this game great graphics and love the surprises we get but the only problem i have is that since the new update i am not able to play this game cause everytime i go into the game i get a loading time out notification(weather i play with data or wi fi)this error needs to be fixed asap cause i trust its not me alone who is having this problem most of us have spend thousands of rands on this game buying battle passes every month I will not tolerate my money being wasted on a game i cant play,3
"A year has passed since my last review... This game is just not the same as is use to be. I was able to play very very good back in the day when it came out. Now is just lag, frame drops, super stupid laggy things but the chatt keeps rolling like nothing is happening '_'",1
"I've been playing like forever but of late, audio has been messing up, especially on MP matches, the game will be totally silent and you can't play like that. You need sound to hear enemy foot steps.",1
Would LOVE to make this a 5 Star review... but can't (at the moment). Ever since I downloaded the update last night the game won't load! It gets me past the login screen and then freezes so bad I have to restart my phone. And no... it's not a memory issue as I have over 50 Gigs still available. DEVS... PLEASE HELP!,1
I don't like how COD picks the items I buy for me! I've spent hundreds of dollars. I should be able to pick the Items I buy! Yet you randomly select the same items and Avatars for me!. I'm the one that's paying for it! You get your money why do you have to choose the Item too when you Buy milk at the store does the Cashier drink it for you? No! It takes up too much data yet We all get the same BS maps. If I get a call I can't get back in the game it starts over. A lot needs fixing,5
I am playing this for long time it was so good but now whoever taken over it its worst even if the network is stable and device is good it won't run properly in low graphis and fram rate its soo choppy almost alll buttons of phone laggs also specially while shooting and even when m in lobby its choppy as hell. Makes me leave this game forever.,1
"Be careful spending money on here. I paid $6.00 for a Card to Rename myself, but when I tried to use it, It says ""The nickname is encrypted and cannot be modified"", So basically if you make a purchase they steal your money. I tried to reach out to COD for help but nothing. SCAM LIKELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Terrible. But, also good. It is the best 1st person shooter available in the app store. But there's a couple things wrong with it, and I hope the devs fix it, without having to have an email with screen shots. Firstly, there's literally thousands of bots, and cheaters. LOTS OF CHEATERS. C'mon, Activision. Isn't there anything you can do to stop the cheating?",1
The game is superrbbbb...!! But what's irritating is the updates !! Every single time I take out some time to play this game... They have an update ... Which takes time to download and den restart the game .... Due to which I loose interest in it nd play sometime later !! But no .... Again an UPDATE !!!! soooo irritating ... I just update it all the time and never play this game !! Just an game which needs update all the time !!! (While writing this review... I am still updating this app),3
"I enjoy this game, but every time I play I don't see any characters of different nationalities every part of the menu has Caucasians. I'd like to play as a brown skin or tan skin character for a change. The same goes for the females, gives us a chance to play as someone to play as that's not only available to pay for. There are so many free to play as Caucasians.",3
"This game has been really pissing me off lately, as a player playing form season 5 2020 the game hasn't been that fun from the past year. The use of persistence in public and ranked matches is too much. The Codm developers almost never listen to the codm community. I really don't want to leave this game but I am being forced to everyday. This game gives a lot of stress and makes players toxic. There is desync and lag even in high end devices. I can't even play the tournament mode. Thanks to codm",3
This game is really fun but I really want attack of undead with the purple Zombies because that was the most fun thing I would do but mostly I thing its really good but if you have like not a good ipad the graphics are so bad but if you have like a drawing tablet or something They are so good but I mostly want both of the zombie mode back On battle royal why did you make it so instaid of the zombies in the clown thing that moves around now it has K9 unite and I really want the zombies back,4
"Game is good but they don't listen to fans. If you want any legendary stuff you will have to pay over $100 and you still get less then a $20 bundle in warzone, if you have a gambling problem don't play because the lucky draw is legit gambling but much worse because you have less then 1% odds In getting anything worth money. What makes it worse is while you spend all that money, people in other countries can get the same thing for $20. They're just money hungry.",3
"Amazing game, I always look forward to playing this every day after school. Its pretty similar to cod for an Xbox or ps4, but there's a few other details that you only get on mobile. This is a great game to play with friends, and I highly recommend it.",5
"The Game is Super amazing üòç, is just that the updates are very big and it occupys much space and make the game lag at some point. But for the graphics 100% okay. Just keep up the good work.",5
"This game is just perfect, words alone can't descripe how good it is I'm looking forward to see more and more updates but I've got a personal issue hopefully you add custom profile pictures (without having to use FB) because the Facebook account which is connected to my CoDM account got hacked and there is no hope in retrieving it back and if it's not possible to make that feature then make a way to unlink Facebook account from CoDM account and hope you have a great day.",5
This games has good graphics but it takes a lot of space and internet to download . And after downloading there are additional maps to download . Its good for high end devices only . I would not suggest this game if you have a low end device .,4
This is a good game it really is but when the lucky draw is only lucky for u guys then this game becomes bad I know I have spent close to 400 dollars on battle passes and different skins and I have never been lucky on the draws I spend and spend trying to get a mystical weapon and all I get are some bs items I just recently spent 54 dollars and the cost of all those things took all that 5000 cp coins and guess what I still didn't get a mystical weapon so yeah I would like what I paid for though,1
I have tried to play this multiple times and I keep being down by invisible players or I'm in a fight and the other player just disappear but I'm still being shot. This game is broken. Also there should be a option to connect a controller via Bluetooth.,1
"As a new player I expect to download maps, weapons, and skins but I didn't expect to get ban for leagues! I kept getting ban because I had to leave a ranked match which resulted in a ban and less rank for leagues. It's was because I didn't have maps download, but at least let me keep my same earnings! Please fix this.",2
"Please add some skin marketplace where you can sell and buy skins for CoD points because that will be easier for the people who have been struggling to buy the battle passes, epic operators and guns, lucky spin/wheel, and epic crates. That will make me and the community extremely happy that we can get cod points without spending a single penny. Also add more uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic skins for the AS-VAL. Bugs: Audio breaks for a moment, and my game won't stop freezing. pls fix",4
Thank you Activision for this game it has kept me busy and I almost have damascus . The lags that people are talking about is only because their phones arent strong enough to play the game how it should be played . Use Samsung from A52 and further to have a great gaming experience .,5
"The concept of the game is good however, tech support could go back to school and relearn customer service. You don't blame the customer for their network you fix your server so that their network won't have a difficult time accessing it. It's called taking responsibility. Y'all should try it sometime. Also take away blackout blitz and leave either Alcatraz or Tank battle. Those are way more fun than warfare.",1
"Excellent. This game is always my go to when I'm feeling upset, it really helps me with stress. The graphics of the game are amazing, even if you dont have a great phone. Def a game I recommend to my friends.",5
Fantastic game however!.... zombies should be like it is on console...survive wave after wave until you die solo or with a group.... personally that would be even better than it is now. Let alone it would give more to the players for upgrades and skins. :),5
"It's almost the same as the ones on console, it's ad free, and it's well balanced. Though, it eats up so much storage space.. Otherwise, perfect.",5
"My first and last review was on 12/06/20. Which means I consider myself an OG player of the game, I gave it 5stars at first but reducing this by 2 coz of the weapons balance... I loved it when every weapon in the game was a choice, snipers where a 1 shot head shot in BR. Now, everything is all about meta weapons and classes. This was my main go to game but because of these, I've made AML my main and CoDm a so so game when my mates want to play private rooms. AiA, great controls and graphics.",3
"This game keeps crashing since 3 days and I can't play it please fix this issue as soon as possible. I am not the only one who is facing this problem. I have active internet connection, but the game shows download configuration failed.",2
"Fun game and daily/event rewards are easy. The ranked has better players and is more difficult, but who doesnt enjoy a challenge. Beautiful graphics with a good processor.",5
"I'm giving just 1 star because I love this game but I have notice that they are doing the same thing with PUBG. You're paying for the season pass and the majority of skins are females. I don't have nothing against it, because there's a lot of woman's playing this game, but if I'm paying the season pass, at least put 2 male skins of the 4. Season 5 all the skins are female. üò°",1
"Meh. Needs more maps and speaking of which, the ones you guys have are boring...Too many ads, too much bullsh*t. Takes up way too much space on my phone. I'll stick with the good ol' classic Pubg. The only positive thing I can say is the graphics are nice. But still downgraded to 1 star.",1
"I rate this game 2/10- it's fun but there are a lot of cheater like unfair players in this game, those on-screen game controllers or laptop/PC players are really making this game hard to play on mobile, you 9 times outta 10 cannot not beat them on a mobile device. It's disappointing and unplayable. Where are the staff on reporting aimbot users. :(",1
"Here's 3 of all the problems in the game. First I get a bunch of weapon blueprints and all except for 1 costs cod points, I think you should not reward players without cod points weapon blueprints or just give the players for free. Second problem is lag when when I die in BR matches, the lag crashes the game and I have to restart the game. And then bots in MP matches, like seriously bots are richer than players now, like the litteraly have skins that are not even IN GAME. So pls fix those.",4
"Awesome gameplay, amazing customization options, and overall a great game. Only missed out on 5 stars because it is absolutely massive, and takes up a ton of space.",4
"You will have to make a melody that sounds like soldiers being called for the war . Otherwise it's a very good game.best graphics, less bugs, smooth but dynamic experience .overall a great gameüíØüëç",5
"it's a excellent game and very impressive for an mobile game , the game is top class the only two issues i have is we get robbed of kills cause you hit like 8 kills in BR and the game does not confirm the kill so you get 7 kills secondly enemies appear from nowhere and before you see them shooting at you , you already down the game requires a very fast internet line for you to be compatible cause i run a 100meg line but i'm mostly player 4",4
There are not much variety of maps in battle royale and there should variety of maps and the game should include more choppers in its map except this game is good.But Enemies can also sit on our vehicle. Cod please give them no option to sit on our vehicle until we left it.And chopper location should not be located for enemies when we use it.,4
"It's very addictive and enjoyable till around level 90, the way the game pairs players is ridiculous, they pair level 90 with 150, and it's just not fun... Players who play on phones is at a great disadvantage against players who play with tablets and iPads I'd give 5 stars but the level pairing is just stupid",3
"Majority of ranked matches are scheduled in similar old maps like Nuketown, Firing range,Standoff etc while COD has got good collection of maps. Please allow users to Play in different new maps. Add new modes in ranked match also if team member lefts or not plays then do not reduce XP of existing players in case of match loss.",5
If you go and look at the 1-star reviews then they are all player problems. I play this game 1-2 hours everyday and I have a decent phone and network so I never really have an issue playing. The invaild parameter bug is not too common(I have been playing for over a year and I have only experienced it 4 times) and it does not take more than 2 mins to restart the game and fix the bug. The lag spikes do happen a lot on low devices but I have a decent device so its ok for me.,5
I think it's bs that you can't use a controller during the championship its considered cheating. If the controller has mods on it yes then I can see it and I know there's a way to detect that kinda stuff. But to each their own.,2
"Just got a new phone and downloaded cod and after what seemed like forever it finally downloaded, now it won't let me play, I'm having the same problem as I did last time it won't let me play cause it keeps saying my date of birth is invalid. Its been a few years since I've last had this game and I'm still having this problem, I would of thought this would of been sorted by now.",1
"Pretty fun. Yet to see a balanced matching of teams but that's the case in every multi-player game these days. You're either on the instant win side or the instant lose side, there are no back-and-forth matches.",4
"I really like this game with how much you can grind, even on a low end device that seems to lag alot I still love playing the game and especially the snipers in it... High power, decent ADS, and how they are to use. Although some of the meta guns need a nerf since they are way to overpowered to play against. (Cbr4 and Mac 10)",5
Am a regular player of this game... started playing this from season one.. it was the best game once. But now it gets stuck In between during the battle royal and warfare. We have to close the game and reconnect it. By that time we will be killed.,5
Game is good to play but horrible to keep. The system has no way of keeping your saved data so when you do something like upgrade to a new phone now you have to start all over losing all the items you may have purchased. I paid for several items in game over course of year and now i cant use them and the game is trying to associate my Google account with a new ID. I want my money back or my account back. My ID in the game was Armyguy2.,1
This game takes half of my phones storage and it doest even run properly. My audio works fine until I'm in a match and need to hear stuff. When I'm in a match my phone is silent. Fix your game. This is ridiculous why would I want to hear lobby music and not my actual in game audio. It's retarded fix your game doodoo heads,1
This is my third time changing my comment and once again this game has gone terrible too much updates and the they need to fix the network issues. Everytime it says timeout or my ping suddenly goes high once again one of the worst games,1
"This game is perfect. If you want a fast shooting extravaganza game to fill up time between your things, this thing does it right. Totally worth the time spent.",5
Very good game. The thing i like the most is the graphix. Ya it takes a lot of space but i don't need to worry about it. My phone is 8/128. So everyone complaining about storage... Just get a good old gaming phone for this pc to mobile game.,5
I just installed android 11 on my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and my PS4 controller no longer works. It's connected via Bluetooth but the game isn't setting it. My phone sees it and I can operate my phone with my PS4 controller but just can't pay COD mobile any longer. It worked great b4 I upgraded my firmware. Please fix. Finally fixed,5
"How do they keep breaking the game even more with every update? Newest season update won't install properly due to network error. Based on other reviews, it seems to be a widespread issue. Servers are totally chalked now.",2
"WHY IS HARDCORE NOT A PART OF THE CORE MODES?? Love this game though and I'm excited for all this new stuff, game was getting a bit stale, I play everyday, but lately been playing apex and coming back to cod when they bring out new stuff that is fun or items I want to get which excites me. Anyway excited for tomorrow, I think with apex out it's going to create awesome competition to keep their players..",5
"This game is still amazing the but this new zombies isnt really that good in my opinion the very first zombies was good if they had more maps. But Creators we need some old school back in cod bring in some older weapons bo1, bo2, also bring some face camos like from black ops 1 with the characters could be any camo but for free even if there is like 10 default face camos'. We need these things back in. But you still have my full attention keep up all your hard work and keep this game going.",5
I love COD mobile and enjoy it very much... The only problem is the ping... It makes it hard to play against other players with Low Ping... It makes the game unplayable most times... I have 6GB ram and 128GB Strorage and yet I still experience lag... It makes playing BR quite impossible... I would really appreciate it if Activision could try and add a South African server... Would definitely help out alot of South Africans...,4
"As a old retro style Gamer from the older call of duty games like black ops and modern warfare. I was surprised to hear there was a mobile game that could replicate call of duty but on the phone. What was a exciting chance to play with my friends turned down my hopes when I saw that the old gaming days were better than what happened now. There's so many cheaters, and toxic people in this game. I hope the team can learn to do better. Two stars for experience. Wish you listened. We made you money.",2
"The game is one of the best Mobile games I have ever played, nice graphics all round good quality but when I download an update I have to redownload my camo, weapons and character please try and fix that, now the bugs are getting unbearable if you get shot in br you lag and next thing you are dead",4
"I Love This Game! COD at it's best. For your phone....Everything about this game is awesome!!! Awesome characters, great costumes, amazing weapon and character customization, weapons to die for....HaHa! Need I say more??? Let's Get Some!",5
Great game/ content but after building myself up the ranks.. buying weapons.. crates.. crates etc it was all lost along with my account when I had to update to season 3. Haven't played it since and no recovery option available.,2
"I started playing the game back in 2020 it was awesome, I had to change my reciew now, because the playing field is bot level anymore, playing against people with xbox and pc and all sorts of external devices are making it hard for the person only using a phone. Still play the game because I like it, but it has become impossible to get anywhere",3
"This game is the coolest, it has lots hove skins and emoths and not to mention the realistic graphics. It allows me to connect and play with my friends and loved ones To me, CODM has no errors at all, all good",5
"honestly im triggered about this situation. I updated cod and it didnt let me in. I deleted and downloaded it back so many times still didn't work. Also it made my phone trip for awhile. I deleted it for some months and finally decided to download it back it finally let me go in but I tried to log in and it wouldn't let me. I used the same email that I'm always use,wouldnt let me log in, it sent a reset pass to my email I reset my pass and logged in found out it reset my level to 1. Was lev 117",3
Absolutely the worst from the ruined zombies to terrible team matchmaking. Of course the pay to unlock anything good and for whatever ridiculous reason you have to play ranked matches to level up you're weapons after they hit gold or platinum something like that and give you so little xp it's not worth doing it. Same goes for the ranking xp too. Also loot drops are horrendous.,1
Great game been playing for about 3 years now always lots of new cool stuff and worst part of the game would be all the constant updates for me because I have slow connection but with that being said in the game you can adjust graphics to help you play with a slow connection,5
"I own the quartermaster pack, but I can't use it. Help, please. It doesn't matter if they have to, im asking YOU, because of your promise, and promotion, to give me what I paid for/was given. I have it in my purchase history and everything, but I can't use it. It's your responsibility to your fans. Help.... Please and thank you. Both Google and Activision are involved, and both should make an effort and take initiative thank you",1
It's a great game but I've been wanting a kerambit for quite a while now and when I finally got one I'm equipping it and the base melee knife is still showing....I have the the camo downloaded and everything but the base knife is till showing I don't know what's wrong but I really wanted that kerambit If you could please fix this I'd appreciate it,1
Been playing since around the 3rd season of the first year. Great game and I'll tell you it's very addicted on the highest level just like a drug so be warned! I would love to see a story mode added to the game or see activision release a codm game that is like lack opps or the original game of Call of Duty that had story line as the game.,4
"100 Billion Dollars later...you need to start adding more security, servers and an anti-cheat. Focus on improving gameplay. You also need to stop changing everything. It leads to this game being inconsistent. I'm tired of half the game being meta and half the game being useless every season. Example: nerfing melee weapons like the Ax and Bat when people are dropping 40 Kills with DLQ, Mac10, Etc. Are we ever going to get the Riot Shield Primary Weapon? This is 1 of 2 CODs all time without one.",3
Remarks for 2022 S2 in India 1) It takes lot of time to start Multiplayer Rank Team Death match when you are having Grandmaster level above. 2) This Rank Hardpoint and Dominance matches are boring and it doesn't make sense. 3) Found that players with SMG especially with Mac and others have high mobility during game and it becomes difficult to kill them. 4) Developers have reduced long shot range of Assault rifle Kilo which is not fair.,3
It keeps crashing each match on a phone that should definitely run it perfectly as a 60 dollar phone from dollar general can because I used to use one please fix the issues it either crashes and sends me to the home screen or the screen goes black a d I can only hear audio,2
"One of my favorite mobile games, just wish we could get a little cod points for free like trade some credits for a small amount or get some in the free parts of battle pass. Other then that its a great game, oh and the ranked matches take awhile to find people.",5
"First of all. Everything is okay with this game but the Battle Royale is a mess. Kindly check your competition. Please try as much possible to make this game friendly with storage space. Every update and season updates always requires so much. This is not a Gigabyte competition, so kindly fix up your updates and storage space management. There is no need for us downloading heavy gigs everytime.",1
"Game glitches every 10seec exact, yes I have counted. It just stops for 2 seconds where enemy,loots etc vanishes. In multiplayerr is says playerr reconnected(it may be opponent or teammate) when it glitches and in BR mode it just glitches normally but in both it happens exaclty every 10 seconds. Network is good, ping is around 45ms, hardware is above minimum requirement, storage space is free and its still happening.",1
"Stop changing Movements Controls, constantly Locks Walking every time I try to shoot, the when I try to shoot with the right side shooting button it does and slightly walk forward and when I hold it it lock walking forward. Fix you're game geez, 24/7 Bs with Activision",1
"This is a very good , competitive game and also very interesting for casual players too , graphics are superb , the themes of Battle Passes are even amazing and adding new maps is also a good feature of this game , I just love this game but the issue is about storage now its taking more than 11 GB of our storage. I think this is the main factor why people will stop playing it , and it is a major issue for developers also please respond and do changes and make it comfortable for low end devices",3
The game is covered in loot boxes. Gameplay itself needs usb controller support. It would be a great game had they not ruined every second of the experience with greed.,1
I don't understand why I have to be downloading all of the maps and the camos everything there is a new season. That is completely time and storage wasting. Downloading 1 plus gb of update then to launch the game to download more than 5 gb of game data every single new season. Please change this.,2
I've been playing since the original season 3 and it's a great call of duty experience but for phones like mine which is an android it sometimes has a bit of lag but in the settings you can change the quality to make it have less lag,4
"It's trash , I don't know why it has to take hours before it loads and always has something to update to open the game. It's annoying , u guys should pls do something about it, it also makes us waste alot on data on updating....",1
"It's a good game, but it sucks more with every update. I can't even see players skins now because y'all made the app device sensitive. Y'all should at least make it possible to transfer weapons, camos, wingsuits and stuff. I'd love to send some to my brother from my account. He started playing recently and he's been bugging me to buy him one.",2
"Love the animation!!! Effects are great... But, almost everytime I start a match I join an ongoing match and it's no fun playing at all (both mp mode and ranked mode)",2
"Going downhill. Used to be a great fair game, now everything kills faster than you can react. If you knew/know Walking War Robots/War robots, its practically turning into that you pay and you win game. Its been almost a year and the Developers dont listen with both ears. I dont recommend unless you want to have something else in your life that feels like a problem. Even if you see user and player amounts or downloads of this game ""skyrocket"" it doesnt mean its getting better. Not rant, its truth",1
"Would be 5 star but when I connect my bt controller I cant look left,right or up,down. None of the buttons work the way the settings says all I can do is walk back an forth,aim an shoot even the tactical buttons dont work.",4
"Razer phone 2: Game freeze when loading onto log-in screen, have to hard restart my phone and noticed it's glitched my phone settings eg: adaptive screen was turned off and my phone resolution was down to 1080p instead of 1440p as I always have it. Not happy how the app has affected my phone now and I feel my phone hasn't been the same since. Any help cheers",1
"Have played since game launched. Use to be my favorite. Now I hit someone with a rocket an they shak it off, shoot me twice an I'm dead... Ranked battles are ridiculous an unfair. New map picking in ranked sucks. Is always the same maps get picked over and over. BR is bull anymore. Full kinetic armor with armor plates full and a gernad launcher, but the guy with new skin shoot me 2 time after taking a clip of gernads... an I die?¬ø?.. An alcatraz locks up every time I've played for months now.",2
"Honestly I love this game sm, I started playing with my cousin sometime last year and got addicted after awhile....it's become an.... obsession??üíÄüíÄno like literally I have to play this daily or I'll think abt it 24/7üò≠üò≠ also yes some people may say stuff like ""play a real cod"" but like cod was actually published by Activision so technically it is a real cod. They also may say it's boring and too easy to play but it's still fun n all plus there will ALWAYS be someone out there betterüí™üí™",5
"This was a great game till everytime I play a ranked match I get completely kicked off the game. And when I get back on I get points taken away and penelized time. I have written multiple complaints but it doesn't get fixed I've gone down 3 ranked due to this problem. codust stand for crash of duty cause it does it all the time. I've written to the developers, to support and even went on Facebook's official group with nothing being fixed. I guess selling guns and credits is all their worried for",1
Alright they've improved the system a bit but now their code redemption website isn't working. You guys should just add a redemption option in-game. Edit: It became laggy again add support for low end devices and make draw costs lower so more players can spend on them.,3
2 problems which is minusing 2 stars First of all their is a glitch that everyday I have to login again And second if you leave the app the download will stop and if you join a game it will get paused so then when shall we download. Other than that the graphics are awsoje and gameplay is fantastic.,3
Game is good. But the administration needs to solve some account bugs. My account changed my name after using it for almost 3 years. And it doesnt say anything offensive as is only my name. I find this kind of offensive as a response from the administration and the administration doesnt get to open a dispute about it. So no chance to get my username back and my friends wont recognice my account. This makes my experience a bit un cool with the guess name on it.,3
"Edit - Fast paced and terribly fun to play. Quit playing a year ago after constantly losing to players making impossible sniper shots. Sadly, still encountering the same after trying the game again.",2
Best shooter on the platform very fun and still gives that same feeling of playing the actual game but one of the settings makes the game very easy and also it takes a lot of space.,5
"only 1 star because you cant hook up a phone controller like the kishi and have it play directly like the iphone version of this app. 100% software/game issue. please fix, i guess this issue has been around for years.",1
"This game is great, but it has a bit more than it's fair share of issues. Sudden lag-spikes in the middle of matches that often cause my losses in battle royale matches, frame drops, control latency, and more. These issues aren't the fault of my device, which is a Samsung S10 and I play on the lowest possible settings with external apps to make this even lower.",3
"Mostly good, a few moans. Gameplay. It will do. Game engine . Better than any. Graphics. Depends on your device, low Graphics high frames is playable. Bit of a device storage hog, large!",5
Love the updates and new content. Keep up the good work guys. I would appreciate if you could make the vehicles in br sound more realistic rather than the monotonous sound.,4
The Game is Superb and all. But.....the problem is the Matchmaking mechanism. Its okay to fill spaces in games or to put people in when someone leaves. But to leave a match in between should have a penalty or something.,2
"Fix the network issue and audio connection issues!! Remove the helicopter marking from map!! Too much lag and Frame drop even in lowest settings in BR mode, it's not playable anymore!!! Remove tensent,the game has become sloppy and laggy.",1
"I love this game too much. It is really good game. Iam playing it from 1yr. I have 150 level. But, suddenly I deleted my game. I was very sad. I started it again in March . Now I have 62 level. My favorite gun is pp19bizon. I fully upgraded it. This new update map is very sexy. Iam from Pakistan. My sister also play CODM. Her level is 150.... Love this game too muchü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üíï",5
I have been playing this game from a couple of months...and I have fallen love with this.. High quality graphics with real life environnent... I ll recommend others to diwnload it... Sir the new level in Multiplayer with bigger map is just awsome... Please let this level remain forever,5
The game has the MW and Black ops map guns etc . Everything about this game is fun . Only problem is the resource pack is to big so I have to wait for along time . But after that Hassel it's fun to with your friends . It has good graphic very smooth so I like this game,5
"Was great game until people continue to hack and cheat, and the people that just pour ridiculous amounts of money into the game to get ahead, I find myself caring less and less to play. Doesn't even feel like it is worth the time anymore. Was better when things first started before all the hacks and cheating and money pits for upgrades.",1
"Never thought i would love these types of games especially when everyone were playing pubg i would hate it ..but this one,everything is perfect all u need is a good device which have good storage because when u download weapons ,maps etc it requires good storage , plus good internet connection needed rest everything is far more better than pubg, BGMI...ETC",5
"Awesome graphics and fun to play especially when I'm in legendary in both multiplayer and Battle Royale that also playing since the Beta. But RIP to all the low-end and medium end devices. The fps drops while playing BR is pretty common too. Hope Activision fixes these in future updates, otherwise great work üëå",3
It was good on my last phone but then I upgraded to a new phone with better everything practically but for some reason I can only get low graphics and don't get any other options and I know my phone is capable as videos and pictures are really good and have high graphics and I've got no updates either so this kind of makes the game a lot worse and boring and I just don't know why it is doing this and what to do.,3
"They love cheaters.You can not respond to the email listed here, once again trying to contact support is impossible. Mythic weapons puts regular folks at a disadvantage because they extremely fast and accurate constantly. Not everyone can afford to drop about $200 for the draw of mythic weapons. Not counting extra $ spent to upgrade it. They need to be banned or put in class of there own instead of regular play because that is completely unfair to everyone Or MAKE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE TO GET.",1
"Great game no doubt I've been a COD fan for years, and I've been on CODM platform for a couple of years now, no problems as far..BUT Call of duty Mobile creators. I know i speak on behalf of a lot us when i ask please bring classic Zombie modes to our platform(BlackOPS) maps the basic zombies we all fell inlove please I hope n pray this meets the right eyes please and thank you #CODM #SouthAfrica #Zombie_MODE",5
Ok needs 2 things 1.canted sights 2.a M203 grenade launcher those 2 things would make the game more challenging and add a entire new aspect to it aswell as making us people who don't have computers or gaming setups feel like we are actually playing like modern warfare. Besides that great game recommend it,4
I would give it a 5 star but I'm giving it 3 because I have a issue whenever my ping goes above 150 I automatically get removed from the game but when by network becomes good and I reconnect to the game and it shows match has ended and shows an option for quit game and when I quit the game my rank xp loses too much and I also get banned from team deathmatch please fix this issue,3
Every one was experiencing this glich including me and it occurs when I try to enter the game (right after the login screen) and no matter what I try it still says timeout. I even tried to reinstall the game but still nothing so Activision or whoever's reading this please fix this.,1
Massive bot problem. I'm losing so much of my games because I'm the only real player on my team. Happens like 50-70% of the time everytime I play. I'm playing on ranked. There shouldn't be any bots on ranked matches!,1
"It's not a game of guns, it's a game of downloading and initialising the resources....!!! Every single time I open the game it gives me a download, not only one download, there is many downloads in the game everytime, it's just sucks üòûüòû Also lag issue and server issues as well üò†üò†üò°üò°",1
Since the new update most of my friends on the list is gone. It says I have 59 friends but only show 20 of them. Most of the friends thats not showing on the list is the ones I play with everyday. How do I fix this its been a problem all day.,1
It really is horrible that on Saturday and Sunday the servers are so week no matter were the signal is or the ping all lag... or peeps are lag switching and mobile can't fix it... ither way things needs fixed. I'm also increasing my stare rating as the servers have gotten better... a permanent hard corps mode will get 5stare from me,4
"Y'all loss a star today not that y'all care. This is for everyone else reading. I am mad as hell, I grinded the game for the backpack awhile back that showed to be an all black version of the glitched pack. Only to find today it's not even that pack it's a complete different one all together. Not just a different color but different in shape size ext ext. I pay in the game for everything I have. To have this happen is unacceptable. I doubt I'll be putting anymore of my herd earned funds in this",4
The game is glitched. When I'm playing in multiplayer mode the screen suddenly refreshes and shows that my teammates are reconnected. Pls fix this as it affecting my gameplay!!!!,1
"I have been playing this game since 2020 but never been disappointed till today. I have just downloaded then when it was installing into my device a pop up window saying ""cant install call of mobile season 4"".Like it could have just told me that before i even started downloading it and couldnt have wasted my time and data downloading it. üò°",1
"Last season my game was working fine with no lag or anything now with season 5 my game takes longer to start up, I'm constantly lagging now and I keep getting disconnected. It's hard for me to play the game now as a low end device user.",3
I am a player and I have lost so much rank during my use of this game because the game crashes all the time . Tried to call Activision and no one answers the phone. When I play the game the game will just crash kick me out I have to sign back in to try to log back into my game and a lot of times it says that I quit the match and it bans me and takes my rank and it's done that quite a bit. Really not fair Activision should at least get a real customer service team and do a better job.,1
"Every time I have a go at this game it wipes my saves... I've linked it to socials, even though it's the least secure and responsible thing a developer can ask for. I've saved keys to get back into my account like it told me, although there has never been a chance to use it. And I've used email after email to make an account only for it to lose my password and never send me an email to reset it. It's honestly a miracle a company like ten cent can continue to spit on their players like this.",1
"The star left out ,out of five .its that the programmer of the game did not intiate the rule that we the players of the game should use a worldwide understandable language,i.e,English for better enjoyment of the game globally. Therefore it's my humble request to the programmer to put in place a translation input in the game so that players from all parts of the world to be at par with each other since we can't be playing together speaking in a native and leiman's language. Otherwise,c'est bonne",4
Honestly this is game is simply perfect I don't have any problems with it except the fact on how long it always takes for call of duty to upload that's the only problem I have with this game but rather than that this game is simply perfect . Keep up the great work:),5
"Best!Game!Ever! I really love that this game franchise is available for mobile users. Although it isn't perfect, it's still fun and even if you don't spend on cp, you will still have a great experience. I have issue that you have to download a lot of stuff, although I can just not download everything.",4
It's not really fun anymore. It's full of features like getting banned from ranked match for leaving when even though I can't finish the match because I hadn't to go. If you get a new phone it's almost impossible and very long and stretch out to get your progress back. After about 4 months of playing all of a sudden it wouldn't let me use my Google account to sign in and I lost all my progress. It's so unbalanced that if you don't play 10 hours every day you have no chance of even winning a game,1
"Now I am again with some complaints from players. And I knew that those things really spoiling the gaming experience. First thing is the resources, if we don't download resources we won't be able to use mythic and legendary guns and see characters as well. So it becomes again the situation to download those resources to",2
The new update is trash not at all optimized. Full of glitches and bugs. This is the update with most glitches and bugs in CODM history. And my wifi is perfect I can watch HD videos and do everything but this game has to give high ping anyways. The gameplay is unparalleled but please fix these glitches and bugs and optimize and stabilize your servers or else this games future is at risk.,5
"The game feels stupid to me. Won't lie I love playing it or I will say am in love with the game but not when I have enough data and a strong network connection and still my game start hanging and it is updated too.Making me look stupid while playing it, you know how it feels when you get killed and not being able to do any thing about it,why? Because. I have a bad network connection which is 4G and a strong one too all I want to say they should look forward in making the game network con strong",3
"Hello Creators of cod! This is the best game now and I liked it most because now there is free katana in mlee weapons and it is the most good thing that we can get katana just by completing mission. The updates are good and I liked how you all are upgrading and improving a lot. Now the game looks better than before. The free katana was in before seasons. I have just added the comment. And also i am just playing multiplayer mode so, just please add more modes in it. The rest is good.",5
I really like the game but I don't like the fact that many people can use controllers and play on pc and stuff like if they would fix this I would have given it a 5 stars but I'm just so tired of tryna rank and getting 360 no scoped out of a window by a guy going prone mid air like I just wish it was all an even player base and not campers and cheaters.,4
Well the game is awesome only thing is it take up a lot of data and space on it phone but u have to know how mess with it so u don't gotta delete all ur other stuff if not ur gunna be lacking in the game but other then that it's a awesome game u get to play with ppl allover the world and there is lots of different games on there and love all the characters in different guns and weapons there epic ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ,3
"ATTENTION !!! Please fix this problem : I still can't use my ps5 controller , i noticed you guys did some changes about controller connection stuff but still didn't fix my problem , when it gives me the option to chose what controller i have i chose ps5 and when i enter a match I can only shoot and reload no other buttons work and my controller is brand new and has no problem",4
"I love this game, but I cant enjoy it anymore.. I played with a friend who only used a controller so, naturally I used one but ever since then everytime I play without my controller connected, it groups me with people who have controllers when I don't. I'm not trying to be a whiner but even when you use a controller the lag created by the game (I play with full bars) the game refuses to listen to the controller's input. It's upsetting, not losing a game. But losing a game because the game.",1
"This is the best App I ever have played. I'm addicted to this game. The grafics are awesome and you can play with friends. Every day I spend like four hours on this game... and to those that complian about the jumping and sliding learn to do the same or this game ain't for you. There is a practice version in the game I practiced and practiced it paid off. Also why not bring in the character ""Blade""?????",5
Would be good if you could spend more time playing than updating. They're not even adding anything worth mentioning. Just skins and temporary game modes. Takes up entirely too much space for what little it gives in return.,2
The game has been good so far but there's something/bug that is makes it crash since I the season 3 update. I haven't been able to play since it just crashes. I need help.,3
"after the latest update, even though my wifi works perfectly well, the ping goes high to the point where I cannot play a battle royale or an MP match. I tried connecting with different ISPs but the issue stays the same. Please fix this.",1
"(Edit) originally I gave one star below but after fixing controller issues I ended up not using it and learning claw method on my phone. The game graphics are solid 1080p and it is enjoyable. No pay to win, loads of hackers but that happens with every game. Very solid game for all the old school bo2 lovers (Original)Controller does not work. Yes ct2 version, yes I'm able to connect, only right analog stick and button mapping is off. Good job cod at dropping the ball at everything you touch.",5
"Playing this game for more than a year,still didn't lose the interest in it. Excellent graphic,visual and sound effects in this game which makes it to place in the top in the list.",5
"You people just keep updating this game and increasing its size, without any major change in content. It's become so cofinient for you to just sit back and relax adding meaningless updates. The same battle royal, ranked Mp, hardpoint, etc we've been playing since season 1 is still what we are playing now, just with different skins and locations. It's boriiiing!!!",1
"The game is the best best for ffp real time multiplayer but only thing that ruins my experience is the amount of bugs and desyncs that occurs in the game i would hope the developers to plz fix these issues and then release new skins,crates,etc so we can have a refined , out of this world gaming experience",3
"It's a really good game I spend alot of money in it but it doesn't matter what kinda of devices you got, the game still is gonna lag and there isn't anything you can do to permanently reduce it. I've did everything possible. Change countless phones from Samsung to iPhones and still it lags. at this point I give up and believe only those who are blessed with good servers can enjoy an appreciate this game... I hope and pray that they fix these lags one day",3
"It was really good back in the days and it didn't even take that much of space ,but now the game takes over 16 GB space and the countless number of glitches and bugs and what not .The biggest issue i face is with my ping. I'm using a 5g wifi which gives about 30 to 35 ms ping in bgmi or pubg , but CODM with the highest speed also it goes to 90 ping. Don't waste ur time in it. The only thing u will get here r Hacker and u will get banned for no reason if u are reporting a cheater. It's paid gme",1
So this is one way to reach for an answered. Why in the game that I am in a higher level I feel I can't get pass that. Enemies kill me with one or two shots. But on the replay they had been shooting longer then what I can notice while playing. Are players hacking the game on higher rank mode?,1
"The game is good, graphics and fps are decent. Overall a must played game. One thing is that the prices for.the skin in lucky draws are a bit expensive even though it's a mobile game.",3
"Still need some improvements for a smoother matches. BTW, this has THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I sent 3 emails about issues I'm having with the game. And still not a single reply. Maybe that's why this auto screen rotating error is still here which was in this game from the beginning. It only happens in this game. And it's REALLY annoying. This thing still happens lol. Anyway these hackers are a pain in the a**. Mods like ArcaMod. It's a shame to see that Activision can't do a thing about it",4
"I cannot link to my facebook account. Everytime I try to link the account it shows link unsuccessful. My internet is working fine. I have cleared the cache of the game, uninstalled and installed it but still shows the same error. Fix this issue please.",3
"This game is so annoying now, Played the game for 600hrs now Played from the beginning and enjoyed the game so much till major updates can for graphics my phone can't keep up and I stutter/frames die every gunfight or any ability that causes particles destroy my frames. Please work on optimization for low end devices for a greater player base as not all can afford $1000 mobile phones This sh** is getting mad annoying now like it's not even worth playing the game right now",2
"Constant issues connecting to server , cheaters are rampant, nothing is done about either issue, if you use only your phone expect to lose often as you're paired against PC players and controllers. Could've been great. Money grab game at best.",1
"Awesome game.Price 4 Items r High & getting higher & when a New Season starts, they push ur Level dwn 3x or more, which isn't fair. Especially since it takes awhile just 2 get 2 the Highest, Legandary & Now that they put a Grand Master in,it takes longer.By the time u get 2 Legandary again, they decide 2 start a new Season yet again & push u right bck dwn.Lower prices a bit,stop lowering our Levels so much, stop ppl from using cheats,& stop ppl from thinking it's a dating/sexting place. Thx",4
I recently downloaded the game and purchased some of the in-game COD coins to be able to buy the Battle Pass Bundle and Beginners bundle (paid direct). After making the transations i did not receive these purchases. When i checked my paypal i actually paid twice for the beginners bundle. I sent activision the report but no response.,2
"Fun game, it's literally COD on a phone. Too bad every mode besides Multiplayer Ranked (and only at Master and above) is filled with AI bots. It would be fun to play my favorite modes (Not just the ranked ones) and maps with a lobby of real people from time to time. I'm not even going to talk about the state of the meta or the optimization issues or the netcode as they're laughably bad. Just play an old COD, unless you enjoy bot lobbies and 15 minute BR wastelands devoid of human beings.",2
"First of; The matchmaking is really trash. I get afk teammates in ranked games and the worst bots as teammates in multi-player. Second; NERF THE BOTS. I played one rust game and the bots hit me without fully aiming their crosshairs a/t me, HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! Third; Again with the matchmaking. It is the biggest issue here apart from bots, my teammates are like level 5-48, while the opponents have diamond camos with mythic guns and are at max level. By far the worse. Thanks",1
Overall it's still a good game but the updates! The updates. Like not even console or PC games have this many updates. If you don't play the game for even 2 days next time you open it there's an update. Even when you've downloaded all the content like maps etc there still updates! Too many updates are such a drain on your mobile data cause not everyone has unlimited wifi or data and on your storage. Until they work around fixing that Apex legends mobile it is,2
"Buggy as hell. Matchmaking for ranked is horrible. I was the only one with a positive stat for 5 consecutive games. Hitboxes are sometimes extremely inaccurate. Since a few updates ago all the buttons became much less sensitive, sometimes I have to hit the fire button multiple times before it fires.",2
"My OG friends are leaving cause of what happen in the games, persistence and melee abuser, unbalanced guns push you to use the Meta for sure, so if you're playing for some match it's okay, but nowadays you'll gonna get headache dealing with annoying scorestreak and all toxic things above, and don't forget the cheaters, also overpriced skins if you get to buy full spins, in term of rewards, the CN and Garena version are better. Like everyone said, the OG CODM are good.",4
I would rate 5 star but the aggressive sales approach really annoys me....buy this now Buy that now Buy this buy that...what about this....give us your money...all of it .....NOW!!! Also problem in lobby's. Whenever a player joins or leaves game its messes your ads up and u stop shooting. It ruins the fun of gun fights as the game don't work properly,2
Great game but would be way better if it would quit kicking me off the entire app every day. It only does it when I enter a match or when I get killed in match. Whatever bug it is needs fixed ASAP otherwise I'm gonna delete it and unrecommend the game,3
This game is the best game I have ever found. The game has very good graphics both in battle royale and in mp mode. I love this game but there is some glitches that I don't like in this game. The main glitch I am suffering is when I play mp matches in Hijack map and when I use k9unit the k9unit is not going to attack enimies standing still there like freezed. So please fix this glitch üòê. If you fix this glitch I will give a five ‚≠ê review üòâ,4
It's a really good game and me and my son are really good at it and it's really fun when you get used to it and when you unlock new weapons and I think every level is good and the battle royale's awesome and in my opinion I think the military base in the mountain is the best place to drop in because me and my son get really far in the Battle Royale spawning in there,5
"Well, now that everything has mostly been optimized in an amazing way, the game is smooth, easy to navigate, and has better graphics than the last time I posted a rating. That's all I needed to say. Keep up the good work.",5
"Algorithm is painfully & clearly biased. One match you're basically battling bots and the next it's a 3 vs 2 (or 3 vs 1) situation that you cannot possibly win. It makes the game very boring. Used to play 5+ hrs a day, now it's no more than 2 hrs.",2
Hello this game is very fun the graphics are very good I have no issues except in battle royal I would like you to add like health syringes back before there were syringes but it got removed and the healing of health should be very slow so you have to use ilke a med kit or something to regenerate the health back other then that the game is amazing.,4
"Terrible game for young minds. Only young minds can tolerate this game. Everything about this game sucks. Buying guns are very, very expensive. All of these smartphone-games are very expensive. Beware. Upgrading is very tedious. Enemies spawn behind you and kill you all the time. The best guns require purchase. And legendary guns are a hundred dollars and up. If you're in your 40s and 50s and you still play this game... You need to reevaluate your life, big-time. No, I'm dead-serious. üòâ",1
This game is amazing. The game modes and weapons including the players make it a different experience every time I play. The only thing I would like to see fixed is the overall quality. For instance the console is much more detailed and headshots are definite. Here if you aim at someone in the head it is a 50/50 chance. But overall amazing.,5
Can't get a hold of tech support. Been playing this game for a very long time. Yesterday logged in an my account was wiped. I had it connected to FB and nothing worked. Now I've lost everything I unlocked and purchased. No way to get a hold of tech support,1
"Not fun anymore. To much Cheatting, hacking. This game sucks since Xbox has the game. Keeps crashing in the middle of the game, the beginning of the game, plays hacking, glitching, tampering with their stats, and other stuff.",1
"I have been playing this game for a long time. Honestly its my favourite game on android forbits amazing graphics, gameplay and add-less experience. The last update is horrible and full of bugs/glitches. The network keeps showing connection issues though I have a goof internet connection. When I try to start game, it keeps disconnecting and says- ""Unable to join match. Waiting timeout"". Please fix the issue.",2
This game has gotten absolutely ridiculous. I mean seriously... BOXING GLOVES??? There's people running around meleeing everyone with BOXING GLOVES!! In a WAR GAME!!!! The new characters and weapons have gotten absolutely f*@#ing retarded. Used to love this game. This franchise. They've lost a customer. Will NEVER buy another game from them. For any system.,1
"This is a very stupid and useless game . Why should I update this nonsense twice and it stii refuses to update , what nonsense is that. Updated the game with WiFi and mobile still it doesn't want to update but it finishes all my data. This is very annoying and I urge the team to do something about it.",1
"Absolutely love this game and will change star rating later but I need help. CoDM won't let my Google account login to my old account on my new device. Have tried everything, and nothing has worked. It won't let me login on my old device either üò§ I'm stuck and have no idea what else to do. I dont want to start all over again üò´ please help",2
"Have been playing this game for last two years. Have been through quite an amazing experience so far. However, lately facing some bugs thereby causing rough gameplay. Hope to find it fixed via this update.",4
VERY POOR SUPPORT! The game has been fine until recently from when it has really bad lag and issues. I am really hoping CODMobile help me out on this issue that I am facing. Atleast I will know how much you value a customer who has been using your product and have been spending time and money on it. I really would like to resolve this Lag issue that I am facing so that I can continue gaming.,1
Please add 5v5 or 10v10 breach and clear the building tactical shooting type multiplayer mode. Where one team will defend the building with hostages there and other team will attack them with strategy and tactics and rescue the hostages and clear the building like rescue missions in real life. Because all the frontline shooting type modes is boring now. No tactical shooting mode is not present here in COD mobile.,1
"Fun Game in general / long time fan of COD franchise (mostly, my reason for the higher rating)- That said, BEWARE ""Lucky"" draws (loot crate) aren't all that lucky. Often times, these ""micro"" transactions/ draws encourage the player to spend upwards of 50.00 to 100+usd (in USA)to get the top tier items (i.e. soilder skin and ""legendary"" weapon - later nerfed) for some comparison, that's a significant amount of car fuel, a couple of take out trips, or w/e tangible item this estimate buys. No good",3
"The game itself is fun, what is bad about; When you have already downloaded a mode or map, you just need to download it again every time. Also the joystick sucks, it stops everytime I try to walk and also it is just moving everywhere and sometimes e.ven gets stuck in the corner making me unable to move. For the gun when I try to shoot it shakes and I can't hit properly, same for when you aren't even shooting, just shakes. Still a fantastic game though",4
"Great game but what's the point if it won't even start. I have a decent enough net to watch hd videos without any issues and other games work just fine. I don't know why this game doesn't even load, always showing network issue.",1
"2 mandatory missions while I'm just trying to connect my gamepad in the options menu isnt just bad game design philosophy, I think it reflects on a much larger lack of general intelligence.",1
"The game is fun but, boxing gloves and dogs really? How is it that you shoot the person with boxing gloves and it takes so many shots but one punch you are dead same with the dog. So many other things that are wrong but not enough time. This game is well below par and should be evaluated and updated. If it was possible I would give it negative stars.",1
"When I go to login into Facebook, it just says authorization error, I even tried install-uninstall the game it just won't stop saying authorization error. I really hope you fix this, I really want to play it again. üò≠",4
This game is fantastic. I play every day. The boxes and draws are such a huge ripoff tho. It shouldn't have to cost that much. The developers are greedy but they hooked me with an amazingly fun game.,4
"Sometimes in the multiplayer section, during a match, your kills don't reflect and the opponent's kills rather reflects. I don't know if its the opponent's who hacks the game or is from the game itself",4
I will change this rating when the bug of not being able to fire on player who lay all the way prone unless you have manual firing this creates an unfair advantage for players to just lay down. This has still not been fixed and i see more and more players exploit this. It makes playing the game not as fun if you can just lay down and kill players who dont use manual firing mode. This is lame and needs to be fixed,4
"CODm is a great game but offlate one needs to re-download maps,weapons, soldiers all over again instead of just downloading new maps or other added features. It sucks . üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº. I hope you guys find a way to resolve this problem.",2
"Pay to play ruins the day yet again. Great graphics, very smooth gameplay and highly adjustable controls. Let down severely by the infiltration of wallet warriors. Such a shame.",2
"Hi , my older Facebook account was linked with COD mobile until was hacked. I open a new account with email and password without linked with Facebook. I start from the beginning until I reach 150‚òÜ. But I notice that you change the report board and infected more than ever with crossplay , I can even play like I use to. I like this game very much , but I thing you're breaking your own rules to let this happen. This is a mobile app , is not an Xbox and Playstation console. I only play fair.",3
"2v2 tournament mode sucks.... There's a glitch when u use an operator like sparrow... After being killed, you cannot use gun, neither you can use the operator.... Moreover, I cannot take my enemies gun with that glitch.... Match making is still too slow.... I guess I should stop playing this üòë",1
"The game is good they just need new content its same stuff over and over. Should have new maps, the game does glitch a bit here and there also. But overall good game. Was hoping they would come out with a COD mobile and it was worth it .. great game",5
Showing error 'Download configuration failed. Make sure your device is connected to a network and then restart the game.' I have 200gbps internet speed. Please fix this issue,1
Game has gotten better and is in a kinda nice position. But for the love of god it had become way too big. I cant even play anymore because my phone doesn have the storage to house the base stuff anymore forget downloading additional files and the high graphis stuff.,2
"It won't let me play the game. I used to love this game but recently it will not get off the loding screen (loding screen and you first open the app, before the lobby screen). I been trying to play for 3 weeks now and it won't work. I've tried good internet and bad internet so ik its not the internet. I've tried uninstalling then reinstall and still wont work. And the last time I was able to play I didn't eave any of my acc stuff (levels, skins, wraps)evan after I logged in with my proper info.",2
"Good game but a moderation feature was added to filter out profanity from Clans names/descriptions. Since then, we cannot change any of it. There is no way to get any support from the game nor Activision website. Trying to replace the description yields a ""profanity"" alert and refuses to save. Trying to change the name is just doing nothing. Because of that, we cannot change any Clan requirements. Please manually override our name/description, we can take it from there ! (Clan: ""69latrik"" )",1
"This is ridiculous and disappointing. Crash crash crash crash! This mobile game should be called Call of Crash! Disgrace to even name this Call of Duty. That stupid load screen in the beginning with the pointless Egyptian animation, I swear it's there for one purpose...TO CRASH THE GAME!! I HAVE NO PROBLEM running any mobile game except for this one. DISAPPOINTED IN ACTIVISION. They been around since 4000BC and still haven't realized CRASHES CAN BE FIXED. üñï",1
"350Mbps Internet and Battle Royales are totally unplayable! The lag is ridiculous everytime you encounter an enemy, and god forbid you fire a weapon because the screen just locks up and when it has decided to work again you're dead. It used to be bad but it was manageable, albeit frustrating, but now it's so much worse and pointless",1
I'm glad to see that cod is disappointing on all platforms now. like when you connect your controller and it says that you have external devices and will be playing with people with external devices or what they don't tell you is that you'll be playing it against them anyways it doesn't matter and you never go up against people that are in the same level as you go into a game in 5 minutes later or some guy with the glowing skin and glowing gun killing everybody and you report them and nothing.,2
The bar has been raised. There isnt a mobile battle royale or multipler shooter that can ever compete.. the greatest of mobile gameplay ever experienced. Even on low end devices.,5
"Until last year, it was a good game, but now all the players have become obsolete, and the biggest problem is lag. My phone with 4 GB ROM can not play this game well even at the lowest graphics. The phone heats up quickly, and after a few seasons, a number of bugs have not yet been fixed.",1
I like the game but what disgusts me is that it is very unbalanced I'm am level 40 and it keeps putting me in teams with 150 players where I can't get kills because they get them all or I'm against 150 and I keep dieing. This is why the game disgusts me and I hate it but like it at the same time. It takes way too much space for a mobile game and it's discussing that you have to waist space to even know what a weapon a skin or an operator looks like or does.,3
It is pretty enjoyable but also requires you to grind to level up and enhance your weapons unlock attachments and camo also the seasonal rewards are pretty nice and you get loads of good skins if you are a regular player,4
Damn what a wonderful game... NEVER had I ever played any game on mobile devices(hi end). Its legit never hang bugged or slowed if uve got a good mobile. Almost free weapons if u know how to play well. Enough modes modified weapons etc Overall legitimate experience.... Draws can get pretty expensive if u like legendary guns.,5
Guys just give up on this game. They don't focus on bugs or player issues instead just keep on adding new packs and all sorts of events just to drain the last of all the money they can get. They don't care about the game anymore and are ignorant of issues. Didn't expect this from you Activision.,2
I love it for the most part just think it needs a lot more options for rank matches and few other things could use some tweaking but I'm sure they'll get right. I was wrong the game is a fn joke hacker every time you play almost. Activision says they're working on it but that was 2 years ago now. Might as well cheat with them cause you can't beat them. I take it all back truth is Activision sucks period.,1
"Ugh!!!!! Why do y'all have to constantly update the game?? It keeps me from playing it! Every time I have had to update this mobile game, it asks for wayyyyy more storage!! EACH separate update!!! I get it.. yall want to add new things to the game.. well then, do separate apps INSTEAD OF LARGE STORAGE UPDATES! So I can keep playing what I like to play!! Besides you should make more money that way anyways! Sheesh! ALSO I WOULDNT GIVE THIS APP ANY STARS IF THE SYSTEM DIDNT CONTROL US TO PICK 1!",1
"Great game üéÆ, no adds, good graphics, and lots of fun. The thing I don't really like is the unnecessary videos of the game which are sorta fake. Also if you like comics they have them.",5
"Its a good game but there is many bugs when i was trying to get the reptile skins it didn't work and the didn't work for the diamond skin aswell and its annoying when u hit them directly on the head but they dont die and why does a gravity vortex gun not kill a drone plus the buttons keep on glitching also the weapons are NOT balenced and the people who pay to get better guns always win, i would put it up to three but all of the bugs just suck.",2
Im just going to give 1 star. Like its good and fun but theres ads and asking to pay sometimes. And its now shot up to a whopping 15gb of space used on my phone. Even if i dont download everything..im pretty sure it would still be 8 to 10gb. This game doesnt need all this nonsense or storage space. Jesus. I initially downloaded when it came out and it was maybe 2 or 3gb at most. This is insane just like ps4 150-200gb smh. Why in gods name is a cell phone game 15gb????,1
The game works great there's some sweats but it's still fun. On the other hand if you want any customizables specifically nyou have to spend more money than it's worth for it. Today I was trying to get one of the new skins and I spent 15 dollars that I'm not proud of and didn't get the skin.,2
Frustrating server issue. Despite excellent internet speed I always gets 100-200 ping all the time. There is always ping fluctuation from 75 to 100 to 200 back to 125. Very frustrating. I used to love this game.,1
"You people complaining need a phone with snapdragon 835 series or higher. Most phones in this range are $400 or more. Lastly, if your account is lost because your old phone broke, you will lose everything unless you used a Activision linked account. If you can't login, try a different wifi network, or make sure your wifi has open NAT, like on Xbox settings. Sometimes you need to use a different phone to access login, if it glitches. Wifi gives better ping than cellular.",4
"It's just a game I know, but why should I lose when I get 70 kills and my team only gets 3 in each match. I can't help they pair you with the worst players come world championship time and I'm disqualified. Make it fair or let me play as a single player in world championship. For making me a loser you get 1 star.",1
Can't believe zombies isn't on it anymore. Loved playing zombies. Apart from that - excellent game. Love playing it. Graphics - brilliant Sound - brilliant Excited - brilliant Job well done,4
This game is a lot of fun and all but you can't practice offine and that is a bummer because I have be playing with a controller for all my life and I just now started with the mobile. I am not very good so if you could game designers and a office practice field if you can.,4
"The game is very good but it has so many glitches The problems are: 1.kill cams are so inaccurate. 2. Every new map is broken. 3. So many bots in public match. 4. Ranked is too easy. 5. Emulator matchmaking takes too much time. (I don't use emulator my friends use it, so matchmaking take so much time) 6.Hackers have taken over the cod ranked match. {IF YOU FIX THIS THEN I WILL GIVE YOU 5 STAR}",5
This was the best mobile game. Ever since I updated the app it constantly crashes. I tap the download resources and it crashes after a few seconds. Please fix this.,1
"Game is amazing, however if you want to make your weapons look good, you'll have to pay. A lot. But all the weapons can be accessed for free so it's not pay-to-win just pay-to-look-good",5
It was surprisingly smoth in it's controls.and as a true pro COD gamer it was super fun to play.my biggest complaints are that there isn't a campaign and zombies is down right horrible.other than that i loved the multiplayer and battle royale modes were really fun and the progression for weapons was tight as frick!,4
"Why can I not stop downloading additional maps when I don't want them? It just keeps downloading stuff even when I stop the download and keep filling my phone up and then the game lags. It's so stupid. If I could use the only few maps I want and dont get other Maps shoved down my throat, my phone would run smoothly and there will be no problems. This just ruins the whole experience. I dont want to download every freaking thing!!! How low an IQ do u have to have?!?",1
It's really good I just don't like the fact that they have hackers that's able to take control of your account and you can't get any of your things back and they tell u there isn't anything they can do so u have to start over from scratch each time u hit a high level and it keeps doing it good thing I don't pay for any upgrades because I couldn't get it back and there is no way for them to get u your things back,5
Best multiplayer game I've ever played that is if you are into action and fun hope you guys at Activision keep it up I've never been happier amazing graphics outstanding gameplay üëçüèªüëçüèª cod forever although it would be better if they updated the BR map by adding some rainforest or something to freshen up the experience .,5
The game needs some gameplay features like Peek and Fire(all modes) and permanent melee button(MP and BR) just like the permanent wrench button in zombies mode. The server automatically switches for which I have ping and latency issues(allow is to manually choose our server). The FPS in some MP maps and BR Maps is not smooth(LOW graphics HIGH framrate) .The hip fire in MP and BR sucks(Make it like Zombie mode). Please add the features and fix these issues. Add ULTRA fps setting for BR and ZM.,3
"so old Ui , bad experience to use The game play is poor.. Sensitivity is hard to handle and you won't get fine results because the game dose not offer a good sensitivity recommendation like it's secret or something.. 90% of the player spamers for shotgun, dog skill, so you have no chance as a new player to have fun or even enjoying this game, also important.. The support is trash even if you buy an items and u have the proof they won't give you back your item or money also there is no refund.",1
"Great game super fun but there's one thing I Hate lag spikes when I first started playing when I loaded into a March and it started it made a lag spike every single time, Same with br and zombies and I put my graphics low and everything else I just don't understand why it'd lagg that much still",4
Its a fun game. For example it let's you customize your gun of choosing and you can change your character and you customize your character and my favorite thing about this game is the battle royal its fun.,5
I really love this game its so graphical and fun you can't stop playing it and it's fun to upgrade your guns but there is this glich I got the karambit from pump the brakes but it doesn't work I even put the camo on it now it shows the karambit in the load out but there's just a normal knife in the games please fix this (it works in br),5
SOMEBODY HACKED MY GAME ACCOUNT When I log in it says AUTHORIZATION ERROR. Just after updating it to Season 5 someone did that. I need my game back fast. Prior that it told me that your account has been accessed from a different location. So I'd like to get my account back. ASAP!,5
I am actually extremely surprised with how great this game has turned out to be. My only issue is Everytime I am in a BR match the entire app will close . At least one time per game... And currently I can't even get in to a Multiplayer game because before it starts I'm getting booted. I wonder if it is because I have reached level 150? Because before I got to level 150 the app never closed out randomly like that.,4
"The best fps and tps game I ever played,very smooth and easy to used controls...with the coming of season 5 I heard that a battle option in the outer space will be there,hope that it may come true.",5
Long time player of the game but it keeps crashing now. Uninstalled and reinstalled but that didn't seem to help at all. Now I don't have even my maps downloaded anymore. Fix this please.,2
"Finally upgraded to a high-end device and now this game is amazing....please take the snowboard OUT this is not a X games game,then I will raise it up to 5!............I've changed my mind to 1 star because of the addition of the pumped class in battle royal is the ridiculous thing ever and too overpowered and ruined the game! Until a nerf, It will remain 1 star!",1
This is my first downloading call of duty but I am unable to play it. I can't sign in whether with Facebook or Cod sign in. It's really frustrating given the enormous amount of data I spent downloading it. You guys should fix this issue.,4
great gaming experience but started getting worse in every update my problem is that the game sometimes close by itself and that really pissed me off and the worse part is any time I successfully made it to top 4 or 1 it will crash and close by itself I don't like it pls fix this issue,2
The most recent update is glitching and freezes before I can get into the game - nothing I do will fix it and I'm reluctant to delete and reinstall it as the download inside of the game just take too long,3
"I was enjoying the game until season 4 update. I installed the game on my Tecno pova neo, played the game twice and couldn't log in again and I have uninstalled the game like twice now thesame thing happened (my data üò´) Error: login timeout.",1
"Been loving the game since it came out, but one thing that I hate the most is lucky draws. They're such rip offs. To get the legendary weapon or the character you basically 99.9% of the time you'd have to draw all the other items n spend like $50+ bucks to draw the character or the weapon. The possibilities of getting the character/weapon is so freaking low. You'd be very freaking lucky as hell to get the character on the 1st 3 tries.",4
"Junaid here, From Pakistan. Actually , i wanted to report a major issue regarding to your application of ""Call Of Duty mobile"", we are facing a major issue of game connection to the server. After we start the game, the game doesn't proceed further from validating game settings . The game keeps on reconnecting to the server and at the end, gives the notification '"" configuration failed, please use a stable network and restart the game"" !! Please sort out this issue as soon as possible , t",5
"Really fun to play. Even as someone who mainly plays console or pc games. This game is one I keep coming back to, though the monetisation kinda sucks.. though that's more of a mobile gaming problem than specific to cod mobile.",5
"A good game but! I have now lost 3 accounts, all after big updates. I go to play the game and it says I need to sign in but I am unable to sign in to my profile. If it happens again I'm giving up with starting again.",2
A very good game. Their are so many modes . It is better than free fire. I love this game . I love this brand . I love it's graphics.I suggest you to play this . I am very happy with this game . You all can download it . No waste of data . But it covers a lot of space . But it works for low end devices too . Thank you . Activision is great . Call of duty is great.,5
I love the game. Its fun and ever evolving. But what I love even more is when it just stops running and turns off. In the middle of a ranked match. At least once every day.,3
Worst game ever as this game runs on a specific algorithm of winning/ losing. Optimization necessary rather than fooling around masses with seasonal updates. Thankyou.,1
"""WAS"" lots of fun. Too easy for cheats. Bad glitches, all weapons are the same so don't waste money buying extras. Skins are ok, getting pretty ridiculous. Especially for a ""Combat"" game.",2
It's is an amazing game and I love playing it but it takes up so much room on my phone. So every time there is a update I have to delete more apps off my phone to even play the game. I love the game play and love having my favorite game in my hands but I dont love not being able to play other games too.,3
"I like this game very much. All the assets are very smooth and handy. Please add new map in battle royale like greenary forest, desert, light rain season, winter and summer season.",4
I hate the fact that this game forces you to mantle onto something during a gunfight this system has gotten a lot to players killed while playing. I have had enough of this bs it takes so long to actually climb onto the object and l am sick of it!!!!!.,1
"It is a very good experience and a very good game,with a lot of guns and different game modes. It's just, I would have liked if the HD resource pack is in the original download",5
"Alright, C.O.D. asks, I'll provide.but does anybody really need to take survey of pro vs. con reviews for the ones figuring if the ..... wait for drum roll....hold your breath... in case you need to know ....7.8 gb (all total) of precious space, yes it is correct, no deception, however, 7.8gb is totally worth uninstalling every other game/app in case you need to make room, just for this one game! No other comes close. Who would I pick as a close 2nd & 3rd? Obviously, any Call of Duty expansion",5
"Too much sweats in ranked matches to enjoy the game, good graphics,pay to win,dessert fire backpack icon does not match the actual model on the player. Good mechanics but some guns are just too overpowered.",1
"Call of Duty will always remain my personal best FPS game, and the best thing is that there are always updates and new skins. That said I don't know why but even though I've downloaded the HD resources, I cannot see any of my enemy's skins or any of my teammate's skins In fact, not that it's a problem, but you may find yourself bored at looking at the same skin for everyone every single match. Nevertheless COD is and always will by my best FPS game out there",5
"You have people playing on mobile consoles and that gives them advantage, the rank match and general matches are a cone, how the hell do you match a lv 11 against a lv 76?? Pay to win is a big part of the game, player with glock shot me from 2 building away and killed me with one shot. Shooting at a player with Goliath guns at close range and he takes no damage but destroyed Goliath armour with a gun with 2 shot, his teammates did the same, shouting and not taking damage i have screen shot proof",1
This game is good the graphics the layout everything and all is good but I kinda have problems with the update requirements for each season the amount of data required just to update it is very disturbing also with each update the system running is getting pretty slow I hope you guys can make it better for us all okayy,3
This game is awesome I like to play but this few days can't enter the game loading n loading and then says timeout I says ok try again then sem problem then I try but then sem problem 30 or 45 min to open and enter the lobby and in the game so many bugs I kill a player but i can't they hit me and nokout pls üôècheck this quickly,3
"Was great! Dropped from a five star because recently have been having connection problems even though my internet is running fine. Half way through a BR match and the screen freezes, i can still hear my character move and the other game play. Really sucks when your on a streak and then the game crashes. **UPDATE: connections issues have been resolved and no current problems.",5
Since the new update the game randomly shuts down in the middle of games. Really unhappy. I have lost ranked matches and been docked points due to this. It also makes completing the new objectives nearly impossible.,1
Game crash in rank mode and Battle royal mode after 2 matches. Also in screen blackout issue in Battle royal match. Overall game is awesome. Need to fix bugs and issues.,4
"Game is way too laggy to play, and the controls are horrible, you cant connect a ps4 controller because of too many bugs, and talk about a pay to win game! This game has so many in-app purchases it's ridiculous. This game is only popular because of the brand name, had it been a lesser known franchise no one would play.",1
It is currently my favourite game to play. Unfortunately there was a glitch and I wasn't able to log back in and I lost months of playing time because I was dumb enough to play on a guest account. I recommend that you sign up for a COD account or sign in with your Facebook account to avoid this.,3
"It WAS my favourite game ... but there are far too many players with controllers, so it makes Mobile gamers far less competitive. There is no guidance on which contrillers work either. Since the update I can no longer play the game...it just hangs and won't load...such a shame",2
"This game is very fun I've been playing for a few years now and every update there's a new vehicle. The only thing don't try to get a legendary or mythical weapon it takes $125 to buy a legendary and $250 to buy a mthyical weapon, unless your willing to spend a lot of money.",5
I Would Give You A 5 star interview any other time but this season there is a bug where i lost my internet connection and it wants me to use my password to login. When i click on call of duty it acts like its going to let me log in but it restarts the app itself please fix this bug as though i really want to log in everyday and play in my main acc,4
It would have been a nice factor of call of duty mobile did not bombard you with advertisements and pop ups to make you give them your 40-hour paycheck. In these such harsh times for the inflation n economy Another bonus would be if you could stack the purple shard plates & have the decoy grenade available for free for purchase in the credit shop,2
Worst game in the world!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! My game always freezes and I've tried it on two different mobiles so it's not my mobile that has issues. If you attempt to email your problem all you're going to get is an automated reply. I wish I could give this app >5,3
Why when I download resources it keeps on auto downloading I try turning on my wifi and then turning it off and it keeps on auto downloading it is just so annoying I don't want to download everything it's like the game. is forcefully putting data in my phone which is fulling up my storage I tried to play this game again and it just not working out I deleted this game. previously because of storage problems and because I love this game so much I came back and said I would download less things.,5
Very disappointed in this game they don't have a way to recover your account. I've logged out of the game then logged back in and lost two accounts ts I've spent money on this game and now can't get into either one of the accounts I've spent money on. Absolutely trash. Of course after reading other negative reviews I see that no one from the company has responded.,1
"Guns Uniforms Backpacks Fancy Motley Colors Rinse Repeat Every Season. We grow weary of the aforementioned. Extra Gear offers No added protection, just a larger target to hit. If you equip all gear the encumberance should also increase. Legendary & Mythic anything still offers no physical advantage except unique animation. High-end guns & gear should augment movement.",2
"Thank you for fixing the issues with the draws. Since my last post I've had an increasingly better chance at getting great rewards. Keep up the awesome work. I love this game i don't want to write bad reviews AT ALL, it sucks and feels douchee.. üòÜ seriously on another note thanks for making me feel good about spending my money again.",5
Series end and I did not receive my series reset rewards... Non of the xo cards none of the credits... What is the deal here I had to constantly deal with cheaters and hackers for well over a month to get to the rank I was at in br and ranked multiplayer and now it's finally over and I did not get my rewards!! This game is garbage...,1
"Bad = super Laggy/major network issues, shots don't register, micro transactions. Typing this while I wait for a game. No real players lame. Edit. 2 minutes later",2
"Keep it up, honestly in my opinion the best one... There's something absolutely special about this game, it's truly amazing how so much is Incorporated from all the other previous console versions of the game... I honestly get excited seeing the new content, although it could use some help with the low end devices and possibly a little bit of help condensing the memory used, but overall in my opinion the very best that call of duty has to offer Please create a multiplayer version of zombies.",5
I Wish It Didn't Take So Much Storage I Can't Even Update Cause It Takes So Much But I Love everything about this game mainly the fact that it's mobile Call of Duty and everything works great! I appreciate we're able to send the battle pass and some bundles to friends now but I would love it more if we could just send CP at least and I'd send some of my friends weapons camos and people I have but there's no option too. Like I said love the game though 10/10 üíØüó£Ô∏è,5
I'm very mad over $50 to get (Gunso) everything but an now you want $50 more an probably won't get it there 2 left so it's more like $100 more not good I have been playing since the beginning spent money before but to get 1 guys is way to expensive. You would sell more if you lowered the price not happy with codm. Up date much better Thanks for listening better,4
"Love building guns. Free for all is great. BR ""single player"" great. This game is one of the best first shooter games. Hate 1.HATE. You put me in the middle of games. You put % on how well I play. If you put in a game that has already started, I now refuse to play. I agree with everyone. Better to quit than mess my numbers up. 2. HATE. No free for all in rank matches. SQUADS destroy match teams. Rank matches need a free for all. Players Don't play ""teams"". They play to stay alive and just post",3
After the new update the game doesnt feel realistic...it looks like freefire annoying animation sound..glitchy movement...it started to lag now..also for ninja class the new marker is annoying always showing red or white dot üò°üò°üò°üò°,2
Its really fun if you like shooting in call of duty play this but if you don't like it then why are you reading this!!!. Listen if you don't bealive me just play it yourself and if anyone want to friend me name: fintastic meet you in the game. Also they should put snipers only in search and destroy much easier for sniper players like myself,5
"Please make sniper rifle use more realistic!!!!! You cannot shoot and load in less than 2 seconds!!!!!! Very unrealistic. Btw, I do not use sniper rifles, but want a more realistic game please",2
"Great game, but watch your wallet. I have spent hundreds of dollars on in-game purchases and was always happy... until my account was hacked and the developers do not have a way to secure my account. Have reset my password many times but all my in-game currency has been spent and all my load outs are changes as if somone else is playing. I also can't login for more then 5 minutes without getting kicked out with a message stating I cannot login with two devices simultaneously.",1
Bruh this app takes so much freaking space. Im a student and have a lot of important things in my phone and no matter how much clear out this app still needs more space. There's legit like a few apps left in my phone cause i deleted so many things just for the update that your forced to have.,2
I've been playing this game for a few months and never had connection issues but after the recent update. I been having connection issues. and now my internet is very fast for something like this please fix it.,2
These draws are a rip off. You literally have to draw every single item just to get the skin or the weapon. A scan just to make you pay for the points. The skins are not worth over $100 in points that's crazy. Could buy 2 PS5 games that will entertain me better than this mobile game.,2
"Playing COD is always fun and addictive. But with the updates lately, the game gets stuck. And especially during Ranked matches. Moreover after ample of attempts of reconnecting. It still hangs.",3
"I spent over $500 on this just for someone to hack my account, I can't personally blame anyone, but still to this day I've been waiting for them to return the money I spent on it and they still haven't, until either my money is returned, or they fix this cause I've tried to on my side many times, imma leave this a 1 star review, and maybe sue really soon!! Still haven't fixed my problem so I started over cause cod was my childhood, still one of the greatest games ever",5
Was good at first but is just boring now plus they charge to much for everything and re-release the same things over and over ruining any rarity to things just cause they don't make much that's new and original. They take majority of everything from other cod games. Matchmaking is pretty bad there's no consistency to it one match you'll get people that suck and then people that belong in higher ranks (I'm in grand Master 2) I'm disappointed to see zombies is still a joke. Old zombies was better.,2
"Just started playing, super fun so far, PLAY IT ON CONTROLLER, it's a lot of fun on controller, and I def recommend it. Haven't gotten anything below 15 kills yet, and it isn't boring at all. Tutorial is super quick, and let's you jump right into all the gamemodes after playing 1-3 multi-player games later. ONLY ISSUE The audio is bugged a bit for me except when I am screen recording, so it is difficult to find enemies if I am not screen-recording. Besides that its amazing.",5
"It's so realistic the graphics are so good, so many maps and events to look forward to and there are so many free rewards to earn even tho you may not have the battle pass so all in all its a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone it's so good! The only problem is lag, that's all I can say.",5
"I've been playing this game since it's initial launch and it was great. Over the last few years though there have been disagreeable changes to the game being made that have made it just as terrible as it's current console and pc counterparts. For one, skill based matchmaking has snuck it's way into public matches outside of ranked matches so now every match feels like a ranked match experience which is upsetting if you wanna use anything that isn't META.",1
"No matter how good I get at the game, I get frustrated by hackers. This happens mostly when I get to legendary on ranked matches. Majority of them use sniper weapon cause they never miss. It's 1 shot 1 kill for them. Try investigating legendary players on ranked matches. More than 60% are hackers.",2
"Again it happens after few months later. What's the meaning of ""Repairing Dynamic Data"" while starting call of duty app that's time it shows like this and taking a 5min. To getting start what's this why this happens again & again? Plz fix it ASAP. Thank you.",3
Very bad experience mostly lagging in both high and low devices. Main problem when we have high speed connection it will shows timeout and no network connection. Fix this problem üòî,1
I would give this 5 starts but I have 1 major problem I can't use my controller which is the razer kishi The reason I can't use it is bc CoDm only supports Bluetooth controllers and the kishi connects directly to ur phone via type-c charging port and isn't Bluetooth so it's unable to be used and is a huge let down I would like to see a fix of some kind for this but other than that I absolutely love this game,4
"Great game! But please make it store it's junk folders (.backups, Centauri, com.activision.callofduty.shooter) and QTAudioEngine file in Android/data or /data/data folder. Storing them in the root of internal storage is lazy coding... Also please add a filter in MP/BR rooms to exclude gameloop players; Being a mobile game, we should be able to play without the unbalanced advantage gameloop players have using keyboard and mouse. Also please be truthful about the game's size - it's 16.18GB",4
Im a PS4 controller user and since the beginning of Season 10 all my controls are messed up and the game is unplayable and i cant get a response from devs.....why introduce controller support and then not maintain support....unplayable for 3 seasons using ps4 controller.. Problem fixed season 3 2022,3
"Such a great game!! It would be perfect if you added some missions base on amazing stories that the Charachter goes from a mission to another , I think this could be nice.",4
"Why i rated this a 2‚≠ê is because I really love the game, but i bought a new Xbox controller and i play everything with it but the only game that doesn't work is call of duty. now some people might say use an app that makes you play with controller but guess what they banned it so i can't play with controller. I wish you fix this as fast as possible. By an old user.",2
"hi team, I've recently bought boat airdopes 441 and boat rockers 450, i play cod alot okay. the issue is, there's a lot of sound lag tbh. lemme explain, after connecting the Bluetooth headsets( any but specifically boat in my case) and click/ play or do anything, the time between tap and sound received from my headphones is more... hope you understood and my handset is iPhone 12. i am a developer and partially tester so, gaming is also a part of my life hope you can fix this issue ? thank you...",5
Don't get me wrong it's an awsome game I've been playing this for years and I don't like it no more because people have been starting to hack the game and yall don't do anything about it. I would love if yall updated your services to deal with the hackers. It makes the game no fun but over all it is a really fun game,3
"This is the best battle royale and multiplayer game on the entire playstore! Trust me, if you ever play codm you will forget about pubgm and ff. It has best graphics ive seen in any of the top br mobile games and i highly recommend it. It is also very optimised and will run smoothly on a mid range device.",5
"Great experience but one event (getting 1000 score steak points in MP) is taking me forever and it isn't helping with the fast rated, One shot kill, and OP guns in this current s season. So pls make adjustments to the event for season ,4",3
God knows why but the game hangs in between. It will run fine and then suddenly out of nowhere game will lag to an extent where u can't play it anymore. Really annoying.,1
This game is good and all but nothing can be perfect so the thing is there are some hackers in the game but I have not encountered any yet but seen people using hack in YouTube something SHOULD be done and there are no lagges or storage problem and no problem with the update and there is only 1 thing there is I hate and that is some players who have cp/battle pass...... Rich player who are using cp have get op weapon so sometimes I hate it but even after them using cp I am the one who is winner.,5
The new update is trash.. My screen keeps repeating itself. I can't kill nobody even if they're standing in front of me the bullets goes through the people.,1
"Kudos to entire team behind this faboulous game..just need few changes in Multiplayer mode: 1) Make martyrdom with less time cos any noob can kill from back and take my Mythic weapon, so what's the point spending so much money on them? 2) Stop fooling people with the name of draw cos 99.99% of users need to spend till last. 3) Make team deathmatch and free for all with more higher nos of kills like hardpoint,150 atleast to win. 4) Show the opponents level in starting of each game.",2
Good game play but I'm done spending money on it. My friend told me that the draws for crates are biased when it comes to getting a special weapon and they are. I get trying to make money off a game but dude just say you want $150 for a gun don't make me buy everything,3
"It was a good game, i have been playing this since it launched but from the last two updates the game has become very janky and it lags so much that whenever the enemy team comes it becomes downright unplayable.",2
I played for a few months and I am sick of it. It needs really good wifi and a really good device and there are a few guns which are overpowered and if you don't use them you lose. It is a big waste of time and money. The skins are also pay to win... This game is one of the worst I have played.,1
Now the game runs great. On my galaxy s9+ I can run maxed graphics &max framesüôÇ. On my galaxy A21 I'm locked to low graphics medium frames ü§î. Even tho the a21 graphics look decent on low for what it's worth they could at least put graphics on medium.,4
"What's wrong with this game! Uptil now, it was going smooth‚Ä¶ But with the recent update, I'm continuously facing error saying 'download configuration failed connect your phone to the internet'.",1
Game keeps crashing all the time at first it was at the beginning of every match now it's about every two min. Please tell me this is a issue that can be fixed. Very frustrating. Started out of nowhere .,1
"Unfortunately, the lags were fixed for everything except the use of smaller sidearms. When that's fixed, I'll up my rating. Both sides need fixing; do not sacrifice their agility to curb lag it's another fail (says captain obvious, but just in case...).",5
I hate the fact that I can't log in to my game at all and I've tried literally everything to fix it so please Activision FIX COD MOBILE! I love this game and I want to enjoy it again. It has only happened after the update.,3
This is a mobile game not a pc game. So why am i being placed up against someone who is on pc. Im getting shot through walls and cross map snipped by pc players. Mobile players can't see cross map even with all the settings tweaked to its high performance. The game is great. Alot of hackers and pc players though.,1
"Worst customer support. I bought cod points but didn't get it. Contacted their helpline and they demanded for a bunch of proofs. After i provided them everything, they haven't replied back for 10 days now. Didn't expect this from a game as renowned as this one.",1
Im unable to login via my Facebook account! It is a great game but i missed 2 seasons because of it.! Changed my rating again. Cant go lower rban 1 star. I emailed them on the contact details and still no reply. Is this the type of service any one can receive from n big company ü§î Terrible service shocking,1
Hi CODM. You are my favorite game. There's no other game I play. I have an urge that please add Sniper Challenge mode as a regular gameplay in Battle Royale as it happens to be my favourite and it is unbearable to wait for 2 months once the gameplay expires. Humble request. Please consider. Waiting for your positive response.,5
"Fix the Lagging Issue, I be honest I have some Frame Drop all over the match I can't even play when the lag is affecting matching, I lose because of no interest of this problem, and everyone have this problem cuz no one from Activion Cares but what they do on this game is to do the worst events where Ain't interest to spend my money, I do like to Spent to premium games and have a better experience Call Of Duty: The Trash Mobiel Edition",1
Nice one but this game should have some offline mode to play so that player can have some more fun while they are not in network range. Improvement required for this particular section. Warm regards...,5
i download the all charector skins but it shows only defauld bot skin so its harder to understand was the enemy bot or real player in BR and MP. now the letest update has lot of sound bugs for example if i use the RPD first the shooting sound it good but when i go to shoot 70 or 80 bullets sound is completely off.this is ruined the game. l love this game a lot its the best mobile game but with this issues its really bad please fix this problems.,1
"Really Great game but just one slight problem, for the past few days I've noticed an increase amount of hackers when playing, let it be multi-player or battle royal you can fire your entire clip on them but they don't even flinch, but 2 shots from them and your dead, makes me so frustrated to see this please help by getting rid of these hackers.",5
"I like the game and I have fun playing it. I do have 2 problems though, number one is that there is a constant Ping spike when I'm playing although it can't be my wi fi because it's a gaming wi fi router with 5G fiber cable, number two is the frames that drops, every time I play and come in a gun fight my frames will drop, I tried playing on low graphics but still the frames drop, I hope to see these problems to be gone in next update.",3
"I would say this game just perfect. But there are some bad sides. Firstly this game hasn't been optimised for a long time and some dates tell us , Activision won't fix optimizing. What's more this game not suitable for low devices therefore so many players are annoyed by lags , especially in ranked match. Please support my opinion with likes :)",5
"Hi Guys, don't install and support this game any more. These game devs keep on adding bots, cheaters and hackers and making the even worser and it's not even genuine while playing this game. COD making us drive crazy and addicted to this cheap thing. This is my verdict better choose some other game rather that this. COD is no more a genuine game.",1
I like this game as it is not use to addict me and I love the game because the Multiplayer mode in the game is very amazing and has excellent graphics. But my request is that please reduce the size of the game as it used to take almost 9 GB of storage in a phone and doesn't work on budget phones. I hope that you will accept my request. My phone is hanging too much and due to that I can't play anymore.,5
"The reason i give this 5 stars and 4 stars is because the multiplayer system is ACTUALLY quality! For a free game, it shows no ads, and you can only watch ads with in game rewards which is great! The pvp is great too! 5 stars all deserved!",5
"Game is really boring I love playing s&d but it only gives me usless maps like haceinda, vacant, terminal, iceberg, crash frequently . I love maps like standoff, firing range, hackney yard, raid and tunisia. I play with my friends a lot like for 12 hrs a day but now everyone is not interested in playing at all so I'm gonna delete this game.",1
The reason for giving 4 star is in the beginning when I installed this game it's run smoothly. But when I was forced to download HD texture pack now I see lags . Please solve this issue üòî,4
"I like to play Call of Duty I have like 2 years with that game and he still amazing is my first time I see a game like that and he got good graphics and good multiple players game. I Love to play Call of Duty Mobile, J aime joue ceux jeux. It is the best of the best game. If someone wants to play with me that's my name Blackroom509. Thanks you for your patient and I appreciate that.",5
"Unfortunately, another download requires lots more data. Perhaps COD could look into the possibility of getting rid of items or customizations users don't use as much. It is frustrating that so much data needs to be open on a phone everytime for an update download. I don't even have many photos or apps and this one app takes up so much room.",2
"The support you give to players whose account have been hacked is horrible! I have been sending numerous messages to say that my ACTIVISION account has been hacked and I keep receiving messages saying you are unable to help as it is not related to the game. One of the team workers initially helped me then sent me a message saying the issue is not related to Activision, when IT IS!! Please sort out your support !!! I just deleted my gaming account of 3 years because the hacker plays on my account",1
"Basically a better version of pc/console COD (Call of Duty). Has more options, more maps, OG maps, different and more game modes, and really cool/a lot of customization including gun fire/hit animation. Control customizations include sensitivity change for ads, hipfire, vertical, and horizontal. You can also expect to move around the in game ""buttons"" and make them bigger or smaller depending on your comfort. Over all a superb game with excellent customizability, quality, and overall feel.",5
Not good because when I try to download the maps it wants to boot me off the game and showed me my home screen and I'm a new person on the app seriously that needs to be fixed right away otherwise other people like me won't download a game that will just kick u off of it and bring u back to the home screen. It's like why should I download something like that if it just going to kick u off,1
Love the Game. Been a fan of COD for awhile but haven't been able to play the games for awhile. My only problem with it is that I can't use my EVOVR control. A controller that IS ADVERTISED AS A MOBILE DEVICE CONTROLLER! other then it my biggest issue is storage space. Please add more support for controllers designed for mobile devices. If that happens and maybe a storage fix is found then perhaps 5 stars can be given,3
There are still a few lags here and there especially when enemies are around you in BR. Awesome game BTW. Edit: Its taking up too much storage. I remember when this game used to take up to 2gb storage. Now it's taking around 10gb. Kindly do something about it Activision. Thank you.,4
"Game is awesome but can we also get guns like u release in the game at the end like the new AK-47 released now coz we love it but many can't afford it and we play for so long so we should get the best guns,camo and much more characters too. Pls look into it.",4
"Button were too close together, but the game was cool. That is, until recently. It seems like every time I play now, the game is extremely choppy. Not like it's lagging. The frame rate is just super low",4
"This game is one of the best games in the mobile gaming platform, but I have 1 problem that's why I am only giving this game 4 stars. The problem which ruins my mood to play this game is LAG. Before the S4 2022 update I didn't have any issues but after the update my game lags unusually. My game doesn't lag when I am in the game screen, but as soon as I join a game my game starts lagging like crazy. SO PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE DEVSüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè",4
"I have been playing call of duty since ages now, and seeing me people around me too started to play. People take operators like Price or others just casually, to me they are memories and emotions. Cod mobile was what introduced me to mobile game but then there should be more operators for people who don't spend money. Crates and all, make it frustrating when you can't spend real money. Please make it like one spin free, or make cod points earnable, not easily, but it should be earnable. Please",4
"It's almost a pretty well made game, apart from the fact that in MP matches, the map generator is TERRIBLE. The game has like 20 maps, and I downloaded all of them just to see the same 3-4 maps all the time. It's starting to get a little old now. And if not being able to get a good shuffle of maps wasn't already bad enough, I have to re-download everything every single season. It's sad really, because I'm just some kid ballin on a budget so I don't have a console to just hop on instead.",3
"Best game ever... The graphics and controls of this are very nice, and the feature I like is that we can also modify the control settings according to our gameplay.",5
"Up until season 9 I could see all the different characters, and now the males look like Special ops 1, and the females look like Outsider-jungle, when we're sitting in the lobby waiting to play, everyone looks like their characters, but in game, everyone looks like each other, attack of the undead, is really messed up, same deal, no zombies just special ops 1 and outrider-jungle, only way to tell friend or foe, is if you can see or not see their names. Fix it please. Still not working.",1
This game is very fun to play. But there could be some things they could put in. Like the same guns as Warzone and to put in maps that look the same in Warzone as well. Like rebirth island. But this game is the best.,4
It's really fun! You get to play call of duty anywhere through your phone. You get to play with friends and find new ones! It does glitch every so often but it is totally worth it! I 100% recommend!,5
It is a really good game.I have been playing it for 2 months but on the last update the screen always shows that timeout. I dont know if its a bugor glitch but i request activision to fix the problem.,2
idk if it is threw the hundreds of updates but it has a but connection system out of no where the connection ist gone I get kicked from the match plus many weapons are doing to low damage you need two magazines to kill someone it wasn't like that before.,4
The game is constantly making progress. There is always new weapons with each battle pass. This game is always interesting. Alcatraz should appear more often.,5
This game is flawless in every way. Perfect and Thank you to the Team for bringing it to this platform. Keep up the good work. Hopefully the upcoming call of duty 2 or warzone be an improvement to this.,5
It's the best of the best! I recommend it. But they have to create a new battle royale ground the old one is kinda boring and were getting used to it... hence we would like something new and mesmerizing like a rainforest in Brazil or som'ng or africa. All in all we need a new battle royale ground,5
This game is the best game for sure but here is the big problem.....it keeps disturbing me to loggin the game all the time and it's irritating and one thing more it takes lots of mbs/gb to update like litterally more more than they show the exact amount and that's frustating fix this ASAP,1
"Beautiful game, fantastic player movement, realistic gun aim, beautiful graphics, I recommend this game to anyone that likes a shooter type of game, this game is online and can be played in multiplayers mode, zombie mode, battle royal mode, in multiplayers there is many maps to choose from and many game modes you can play solo, duo and squad. In zombie mode and battle RYL you shall find out, when you start off it is easy but get at master rank and the player shall be better and harder to kill.",5
"What happened to showing how many kills you made? No one cares about a ""rating"" that you replaced the kills with. This sucks now. Is Battlefield Mobile up yet? I'm going to check because this ""killed"" the game for me. Political Correctness? You don't want to show ""kills"" even so we are shooting each other? This is supposed to be war. You go thru the hard work and want to see how good you did, then see a rating. You have to count the kills in your mind as you play now. Woke makes you go broke.",1
The game is a blurry mess on big screen tablets like Samsung Tab S7+. My tiger can handle Genshin Impact at high graphics and resolution like a pro. CODM's Android development team is a joke. It prob didn't occur to them to reconfig to higher resolution for devices with larger screens. Disappointed that people like pass game development.,1
"I do not recommend this game. Very frustrating, tons of lag even on a new upper model 5g device, takes up massive memory space, game low key cheats you on top of allowing hackers to run rampant. On top of that...support is non existing for the most part and probably could care less about the game being ruined because us as consumers will still buy it like mindless zombies because it's a call of duty game",1
My PS5 controller won't work on cod mobile it's quite annoying I have 6 controllers..... Issue with Every single one: r stick won't work. So please update dualshock support or what ever y'all need to do. Love the game pretty good at it too Update: you all updated the game to include what controller you're using but my controller still won't work,3
"Amazing game Activision,the game itself is the greatest this store had ever seen.the gunplay is smooth but could been better,afterall it slightly had mw19's vibe to it so,i wish the game was a little more Astheticaly pleasing as mw19,you know a little animation tweaks here and there are appreciated,also the hud could a been a little better too.apart from tgis there's nothing really.oh and some wierd bug like my slides wouldn't be smooth or I can't doslides properly i would be just becrouched",3
Cod is my favourite for all time No one can take the place of this game. You can play for free in low spec devices . My goal is to take place in the rank #1 in the leaderboard and that is all. I am in grand master rank so i can do it .so take the best decision in your life !!!!,5
"Super laggy on a new phone, quit and tried to reconnect to fix and I was penalized for leaving. Like sorry I didn't wanna spend the whole match trying to run out of a corner of the map. Fix this trash and maybe I wouldn't quit.",1
"After playing to many years of codm that time I rate this game with 5stars. Year of 2022 has started codm is going down . season 1 &2 2022 was fantastic.when started season 3 &4 are very werst less now Started game lagging , glishes, game starts freezes to many bugs and heating issue. I have good device Redmi note 10 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage .I can't handle now this to much game size now become till 9 gb I am leaving codm forever . üíî.",2
The game does unnecessary download files that don't work like the high audio/ graphics they are downloaded but fail to show up on settings menu also the skins don't show on mp or br matches so paying for them and the meta gun effects is a total rip off. Please fix asap and I'll rate higher,2
Great game I love playing it but the issue that needs to be fixed ASAP is everytime you go to the app you have to redownload your maps again that's been a issue since I first started playing the game,5
why do we crash so much like if im in a ranked match and the app crashes we get this damn lock and rank xp stuff its really annoying please fix the app crashing whats the point of having a pentaly for leaving on purpose because you know you wont win its just unfair oncreases more more and more,3
"New update is a joke! New multi-player map is bugged because you can empty a whole clip on your enemies and they don't take damage, but when I get shot, it takes 3 bullets.",1
Initially the experience was great but laterly it became frustating because of the continuous upgrades and with each upgrade the more lagging problems secondly a lot consumption of device storage space,1
I will be deleting this game...I've played for several years and spent a lot of money but this is no longer call of duty mobile...the use of the controllers is getting outrageously ridiculous. These guys cant play unless theyre using controllers. Go play xbox doucebags. Time to find a different game.,1
"This game is neat and all, but I wish you guys would fix the match making and the ranked. I keep being placed with absolute trash teammates, it's annoying that I have to always have to sweat just to carry my team. I shouldn't have to be that greasy just to have fun.",3
"Thanks to the Activision team. I suggest after passing the upgrade, for example, 10 rifles to the final level. The player will receive a Legendary Gun as a gift from your team. In this case, the number of your players will increase every day. Thank you . I'm a sniper üòÅ",5
The game is cool but when I am in a match with my friends the audio cuts out sometimes and they said they have the same problems as well pls fix this also it sends me back to my home screen this happens to my teammates as well. üòÅüòÉ But otherwise I Iove the game.,4
"The game shows new problem. When I start the game, there is shown that the device is not connected to the network , while the mobile is connected to the WiFi network. Please do needful. Thanks.",1
This game is so addictive but the lucky draws are too expensive 100$ for a draw it's too expensive. Please fix this problem and make draws less expensive that most of the players can buy cp and try luck in the draws at low cost.,5
You must let us also fix our health instead of our bullet proofs only ..we are dying unnecessarily.. please allow us to boost our health as we run towards the safe zone ..and another thing.. please let us carry 3 guns ..w pistol/shot gun .. assault weapon then a sniper..it's pretty cool to be shot and use your pistol or shot gun while on your knees..then fix your self n move ..it's boring to wait for someone to fix u when u got everything,3
Would be better if you look at your game and straighten it up. I was trying to play a warfare and my game stopped responding like always and then my whole phone just hanged up and after a while my screen went black. No wonder people don't play this anymore.,1
Looks like hackers are getting banned. Its a little slow at banning hackers but its a start. I hope many more get banned. That gets 2 stars. Lag is still there but not as much as it used to have. Wich gets 1 star. The low graphics are causing problems on battle royale. It gives some enemy players an unfair upper hand when they are shooting at you from a few feet away and you cant even see them. A vehicle suddenly lands or shows up out of nowhere near you because you cant see them coming.,3
It's a great game. I have bren playing it for awhile now. My only problem is when I tried to long in it talked about needing files or something so I can log in so all my saved progress would pretty much be gone if I make a new account.,4
"It's quite addictive . Graphics are smooth, post recent update, game freezes every few seconds and too often gets disconnected, it's so frustrating to continue with the game. I have not uninstalled the game for the love of this ge, lest would have removed it. Please validate the issue before releasing to the world. I am rating this down because of the recent update and will change only when the issues are fixed. Why weren't the new locations on BR introduced in phases may be gap of few days.",4
"I swear these crates are rigged to give you the crappiest loot first so you end up spending $100s+ since they go up in price after every opening. Complete rip off!! Note: a lot of the items available cannot be earned without spending money. There's better things to waste your money on than this game!!! Ps: SOME CRATES HAVE DUPLICATES!! Screw this stupid game, nothing more than gambling.",1
"i find it absurd how the s21 ultra can play on maximum graphics and maximum frame rate but my s22 ultra can only play at maximum graphics at high frame rate. It really brings the experience down and i would like it fixed in the near future. (S22 ultra, Exynos 2200)",3
I like this game and enjoy playing it... only problem I have is when you do an update (which occurs all the time) then you have to download all the inlay stuff like weapons maps etc. if I up date it why can it update everything at once. I just did an update for 1.2 GB I think it can be done with an update that large. It wont let you play until you do that secundary update. If its an update do everything at once If it wasn't for that I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for that,4
"Update2: ranking reset after update. Update: waiting too long for match start, and then banned for abandoning long start. Championship was a fraud . Couldnt make a team. Instructions sucked too. Heavy updates very often data waste",1
Constantly get kicked out or freezes in the middle of a match resulting in being killed. Only happens in battle royal mode. Using note 10+ issue has been fixed,4
"Great....the game has improved a lot, just need little fixes like persistence balance game is little laggy and the server is kinda laggy. Please it will be nice if you guys can add swarm also in the credit shop. Please make sure to fix these problems and i will edit my review and give you 5 stars. Thank you codm",4
"Its good. The gunplay is fun, while there are things you have to pay for, but they aren't needed to be somewhat competent. On my device lag is not a problem. My only complaint is the mx9, m13, and kilo not being nerfed.",5
"I love playing COD. As busy I am with my work schedule, being able to take COD Mobile on the road is awesome! Overall, great weapons, great maps. Multiple maps on BR. Great job guys!",5
"When the game runs good...which is rare...I have excellent wifi but it's getting more frequent...game lags hardcore..especially in bigger matches...the advertisements are getting ridiculous ...like 4 of them asking me to pay everytime I open the game....sadly this game has turned into pay to play...where rich kids buy alll the unlocks and the rest of us are at a disanvantage...and don't me get ,started on. The bots.....Bs money grab",1
What a game and time passer Being at low level 27 and fighting against high levels 150s my guns are not upgraded enough to defend myself I can unload a whole clip in close quarters on them and they shoot me a couple times and I'm dead. I expect to fight my levels Mvp in MP most games Last man standing in BR all games unless I kill myself in helicopter trying to land getting in passenger seat I'm elite 4 lvl 27 why should I be fighting levels up to 150. What an awesome game for a phone.,5
It was really fantstic game.I am still playing this game..but after the lst update of season 4 the game became slow and shivering all the time.even in high spec phones too facing the same issue.Now total size of the game is 14GB !!! Its too big ...thats why it is getting slow all the time.pleade.do necessary things.,4
The game is awesome!!! But it takes up so much space you have to have a phone with very large internal memory to continually update each season.,4
Very nice game i am playing this game since 1.5 years and i love it its a very high shooting game and also it require constant internet and my over all experience is very nice once you make a call of duty id so whenever you download this game again so you can simply log-in to call of duty id and you-re done your old id comes back. It has many many guns and there is a ranked match option where you can increase your rank and i am in pro 1 and my experience is very very good.,5
"Amazing for a mobile game ,its almost like playing it on xbox ,the only thing i dont like is how it makes me delete apps i use daily during updates, if they could fix that and add some new guns and maps this game would be 10/10",4
"My game isn't starting, it takes me to the main screen, logs in with Facebook and then says time out and restarts. It has been an hour now and it's annoying cause I am missing out on a stupid tournament I want to play and I can only play it within this time period!!",1
"It has an annoying feature, it downloads updates evey hours in starting of the game (specially at first week of new major updates) and it takes about 4-5 minutes to load the home page, If we don't want to download updates, it doesn't start anymore. I mean what the hell is this? this is a mobile game, it should load fast so the player can play quickly.",2
"OK it originally was good but the new update really is getting on my nerves,anytime it gets 99% it'll just stop and say timeout then I have to log back in again. Sometimes after I log back in it works, but other times it won't then it'll just keep saying time out over and over, soooooo please fix it.",3
"I love this game, but lately it freezing,my gun isn't loading, i cant move, pls stop updating and fix the bugs, i know it happening to a lot of people, i can't even play battle royal, and i love it..... Please fix it",1
"The rank system needs looked into, im in Pro division and unable to find a match. I'm very disappointed because other ranks below and higher can find matches.",3
"The Game eats up whole space of about 15GB in my phone, it desperately needs an optimisation. Hope the Deaf Devs do it someday before Gamers choose to migrate to another Game of the same kind. Being kind of attached to the Game lately but it's dying and they don't seem to take the situation seriously enough.",2
I love this game it looks and plays just as good or better than it's console counterpart and the battle royal is a great bonus along with all the extra operators that you can play as great job guys!!,5
"GAMBLING SCAM!! Honestly love CoD and have enjoyed the game for the most part, but I've literally put in HUNDREDS of dollars(over a couple years now) towards their ""draw"" purchases and have NEVER gotten the showcased weapon. The SECOND that apex legends mobile goes live ill be deleting this game and making the switch. At least their purchases are all cosmetic where CoD's are literally pay to win for some things. If pubg was good id just play that, but for now I'm stuck with this scam of a game.",1
"I have been playing this game for over a year and on every update weapons are buffed or nerf. As soon as you get use to your layout CODM developer's destroys it for you. The mythic AK do not kill a enemy if the ping is above 90 ms, waste of money, Do not recommend to spending money on this game anymore. With current season the Oden ground loot and almost all ground loot is stonger than any of your expensive gun skins. Ridiculous!",3
"I gave it 2.5 stars...because how many times do I have to download and update this game to play it? I just downloaded every single map, weapon, camo, and soldier 3 days ago. It took over 20 minutes and I was using WiFi. But now? I need to download 2.2 GB again??? What the heck is this? ü§¶ü§∑",2
"I just reinstalled the game after not playing it for a couple of months. It now takes up over 10 gigs. Even though you supposedly the option of saving the game to an external drive, it still saves to the internal drive. If you choose to save to the sd card, it takes up the space on both internal and external drives. what's the point. This new version overheats phone BADLY while playing. Over 8 1/2 gigs of free space on phone +strong signal. It still lags and freezes up.+More issues. GAME RUINED!",1
"I am very impressed and never really thought I would come back to enjoy the FPS genre after being a MOBA enthusiast for the past decade. Great game, really well made! Only one small criticism towards the lack of info on what settings will do what, and there is so much settings... Just make it so there is a question mark button somewhere, explaining a bit about the option when you select a certain setting. But still absolutely 5 stars!",5
This game is so magnificent and awesome easy to learn controls and absolutely love the graphics they blow my mind on how detailed everything is and the battle royals are stunning and addicting to play highly recommend to play!!!,5
"Facing latency issues with the game after the last update. Please help. There is always an issue after every update, the game fails to even start regardless it's connected through a wifi or mobile data.",1
Enemy fire anywhere and I get hit bullet fastly but I hit enemy with gun then he cannot die why and from some day game is working very very badly in my phone my phone specs is 8gb ram and rom 128gb and not working fast and when I was playing ranked game it slows and your draw system is very bad somebody gets mythic gun in one draw I draw many time but why I cannot get in one draw why this unfair with me,1
"Game is amazing, but I got problem that it is showing ""recourse downloading failed"" and saying ""connect to network snd then restart the game"". I don't know why bcz at my place speed of internet is very good and I'm connected to the network obviously üòÖ.",5
Installed the game (took almost an hour). Logged in with my activision account info. Played one round. Got a lot of kills and only was killed a few times. After match was over I clicked on open chest now and a message popped up saying I was banned for what looks like a day. Don't know why I am banned. Since I'm banned and can't log back in to find out why. Guess this game was just a waste of time and I'll play something else.,1
Im facing issues in playing game from past few days on airtel Fiber. Continuesly im getting this messege Download configuration failed. Make sure your device is connected to a network and then restart the game.,1
"Ok so I play this game A LOT, but one time, it logged me out, and I had forgotten password, I tried looking for it on Google and my phone but it was nowhere to be found. So then I tried to reset my password, by using my email BUT, it wouldn't send it because I had apparently already reset my password before, so explain me this devs, why does the email reset password ONLY WORK ONCE?So now im locked out of my account AND I SURE AS HELL AINT STARTING OVER! Edit: sorry for the rant I figured it out",5
"I reallyove this game, it is my favorite game, but I believe seasons should be a little longer, at least about half a month, the only way to level up to level 50 is playing every single day, if you could do something, that would be nice :)",4
This game is very excellent . Best fps game I played. Grafics are insane. One of the best thing we can play private room with friends any time and it's totally free. Battale pass offeres are very nice and also I don't need to tell about lucky draws. My phone has only 3gb ram and 32gb rom. My game was very laggy and chopy but I'm still playing this game By the way Thank you so much activision for giving us this insane game and we hope you will more improve the game. üòäüòäüòäüòä,5
Overall the BEST app on my phone üö´üß¢‚ùóI think that the guns on Ps4 and Xbox1 should be on the MOBILE game as well üòï. I also believe that the crates are VERY EXPENSIVE to get the things that are ADVERTISED the MOST.. They make it SEEM like a DRAW for NEW CHARACTERS or CUSTOM GUNS but in REALITY you have to SPEND at LEAST $50 to $60 to get something like that.. other than that this game is really cool üòé,4
"It's keeps going to the home page when it gets to start playing. It looks like it want s to start but it just go to the home page right after that it went to the home page like 30 times, what do I do about it please give me a suggestion for this game",1
The gameplay is good but the number of updates is too much.. like every time I start the game there's an update which is annoying. The amount of time I have spend on updating is way more than that i spent playing!,3
The game itself cheats on you not to mention bots. With one same connection going from unranked to ranked is like night and day with all the sudden and constant lag in ranked mode.,1
I've been playing this game for several years and recently I've been trying to go for completion camos. The one problem I have is that it takes such a long time to get the camos. I understand that you have to grind for it but I feel like it would be better if it you could get something like diamond camo faster,4
Such a great game I've been playing call of duty since 6th grade. Over 20 years ago always been an great experience on xbox and on the phone. Was definitely surprised how enjoyable it is to play on a phone obviously not the same but still absolutely amazing. Good Job! & Happy gaming!,5
First of all i want to say the game is pretty good The way the developers introduce the gameplay experiences is great but the negative part of the game is full of bugs i dont think the the team working behind do not optimising the game and the Next main problem to our players is full of hackers we cant even play with those bullshitt hackers. Please kindly make a response to all these problems .,4
"Updated review: Everything is working great again! This is my favorite mobile game on the market! Great job on the game! Devs should be happy with creating such a great game! Only bad thing about the game is, I play it for hours on end! Almost every single day! Lol! Great game! Best FPS out there for download! Go team!!",5
The game is amazing to be honest i do love it but i think you should add more skins because players around the world don't like using the same skins as another player so it's either create more skins or let us create our own which i think is also a good idea because then we can buy our own clothing for our specific player and i think you should do more tournaments especially including winning items or money.,5
If an honest opinion is what you want then honesty is what I'll give. It's a fun game and I'd recommend it but if your a die hard type of player be prepared to pay for the cool weapon skins and don't get me started on Mythics. But that being said I can speak on these subjects because at present time I have 2 Mythics and probably 30 of the orange special weapon skins with kill effects. But I am not way knocking this title I play it regularly.,5
I began playing the very first day! Love ‚ù§ this game!! Until now. I have a 32gb storage on my Samsung Tab and a SD card with 128 gb. I loaded everything possible on SD. I got rid of everything except CODM. But I cannot update. NO room. Suggestions?,3
"I like this game and I have been playing for a while now. I am giving only 2 stars because as I have played this game it has become apparent that there is either a ton of cheating going on, or people are using controllers on their phone. I play this game with just my phone and it is getting ridiculous how hard it's gotten.",2
"After recent update of this game , I m unable to play... it's just asked for login option I selected with Facebook from starting and now the game restarts and wait for login again, if I go for another option like guest than my data will be erased .. Plss Help me with this problem Infact I have uninstalled the game and downloaded again but the problem remains the same.. I stated playing COD when I was a teenager and(32) now I don't know the reason why I m unable to play",4
"You guys are killing us with the size of this app!!! I have nothing else to delete from my phone to justify your updates. .... the size of this app needs to be revised, or people are going to have to start deleting the app... .. Cheers to Activision either way..",4
I've been playing this game for 2 years now.... Since the beginning now going 3 and let me tell you about this game. I'm a good player. Not the best but good but the stupid game handicap you if your good or better than average..... It pairs you with bots or worse people that are afk.... Yes I mean people that are just there to stand there.... Basically no help at all!!!!!! Even with this major problem!!!! I continue to play..Why? Because I'm addict..I wish this stupid game could fix it's problem,1
"After the new update 6.0 ,..it's gitten worse. One of them,is the removal of missions on battle pass,... Y should I grind for a thing that I've payed for that too so many matches per day. Worst idea ever to remove battle pass mission.",2
"The game crashed, deleted my account, and I lost all my progress through no fault of my own. I didn't uninstall or log out it just restarted my account! Stay away! The ""engagement optimized matchmaker"" is designed to manipulate your winrate to make you pay and play more.",1
"Here's an honest review. I started with the game a year after it came out I enjoyed it so much because it played properly on my mid ranger. Since last year the graphics and maps have changed changes, and require more graphical power which my phone unfortunately can't handle anymore it makes the came mostly unplayable. If they can figure out how lower the graphics power required to play the game, myself and others would really appreciate that.",1
"Since the last update, the game system has improved a lot. especially the connection issue. However, it is still too tough with high-end phones. needs real optimization !",4
"I love the game, but the only reason to give it a 1 star rating is becauseI am unable to login to my Facebook or Google account after re-installing the game on my phone. This is an ongoing issue with many users for a long time. All my progress is lost now and I can't get the saved progress. I have to start my game again.",1
Best game on play store I think. and the bluetooth compatibility for xbox 1 and ps5 controllers make it a solid gold 5 stars. Keep up the good worküòä. Down fall on this game is you're got to spend 100s of dollars to pull legendary weapons though.,5
"I am a great fan of cod series.Cod m is really a great game with insane graphics. But in present time it is no more fun. Creators are hating it's multi-player ranked mode because of the scoretreaks and lack of meta gun. DEVELOPERS,please listen to me if you want, that people no more hate CODM Then do these things please remove scoretreaks, perks,opreater skill from the ranked match.Meele are one shot it makes the players angry, nerf meele. DIVIDE it into two games 1 for br and another for MP",5
The game mechanics and everything is fine. Please increase the red colour of enemies.They are barely visible from mid range and long range.,5
"So glad they finally brought it to mobile. I hope the bring more maps in. Love being able to play the old maps again. Update: loved playing but now(2020) the game is unplayable, I assume their servers cant handle the players.",5
"will u guys bring back the original zombies that there used to be please. like the ""true"" zombie mode where u run loops boarding up windows and hitting the mystery box? plllleeeaaassseee!!!!. we want classic zombies back. this new zombies is garbage. and when i say garbage i mean scumbag garbage. theres nothing like classic zombies. update: the game has been pinging alot for like 3days. sometimes ill get like 200 ping on and off during br matches. my ping is usually a healthy 42-56, please fix",4
The game is fun but unless you put alot of money into the game you won't be very good. Also recently my game has been glitching alot. Seems to be constant problems.,1
"A great game ,but having to download guns, operators,maps ,camos all over again each time there is an upgrade is pure wickedness.. And the game consumes so much space",2
"My favorite game is on mobile which got me so excited to see if its the same, but it wasn't. Although, I still like the style that the loadout option is in. Its just like warzone and call of duty modern warfare. I also like that they have a battlepass. Thats what ble wmy mind the most! Because i was really excited to buy it, but then I found out they dont give free cod points in the battlepass just like warzone. That was a huge let down, but at least they have skins in the game. Thank you a lot!",5
"Controls are smooth and unique, They are easy to use, The Graphics are pretty good, Some Weapons are a bit overpowered, but mostly balanced as of right now. I do think more Snipers are needed. A Suggestion would be the Barrett M82 I think it would make a good addition to the game. I would say it's worth the download however it does take alot of storage.",5
"I have two issues with the game 1. It can be played on wifi without any starting trouble but when the game is started with mobile data it's showing ""check your network connection: error 42A"". 2. The mic operation us not not working occasionally. I hope I get a solution for this as soon as possible",1
I love the experience but with every update we have to redownload our maps and other resources not impressed with that because it consumes a lot of our data some of us don't have WiFi.,3
"Everything is good the graphic is good not laggy if you ahve good wifi but it just restarted dthe whole game and I lost 2 and half years of games. Guns,achievements friends and whatever is in the game. But it's pretty good game",4
"I wish I could give this game 5 star rating. This is my most favorite game. But after the world championship tournament event has come, I couldn't play MP Rank Match on Gameloop emulator. Please fix this problem as soon as possible then I'll give this game 5 star rating. If this is not right to play on emulator then why you put this game on emulator? Either fix the problem (MP Rank Match matching problem) or remove the game from all emulator.",1
"Weapon Mastery gets stuck at diamond level (2000+). I reached all necessary requirements, such as Pro level at Ranked matches... Just to find the game has a bug, no one in the dev team seem to care about. Also I wrote my initial review when I was banned from the game without a curtesy of explanation.",1
Please spend a little more time on the gameplay because I have a phone that supports 1440p resolution and whenever I go onto Call of Duty it says that I'm using low Graphics quality even though I downloaded the HD resources Graphics Pack and it also says that I can only use medium frame rate even though my phone has over 120 FPS supported with my 1440p that can also go up to 4K so I have no idea why it still says that the video resolution cannot go above low,4
"Im sorry but thi games physics are mental. You jump from a vehicle you die. You get hit by a vehicle you live but are sent flying, an then the worst of it all, you shoot someone with a tank shell. An it takes two hits to kill someone now that is the most idiotic thing possible of all these things. Game is fun if you can passed those dumb things. Which makes some modes just crazy annoying to play. Just saying you need to fix this an ill raise my star rating but as of now 1 star is all u deserve",1
Game constantly keeps kicking me out of battle royale right before engagement it kicks me completely out the game i was high rank and its like it kept kicking me in ranked so I keep loosing rank and points because game keeps kicking me all around pissed about this I enjoyed the game but the experience sucks will not play no more till issue is fixed,1
"So hard to get into ranked matches using a PS4 controller. Takes a few minutes, sometimes never. Hardly any lag. Only when I play in a group.",5
This game is amazing it has lots of different weapons and other things you can equip. You can also pick different maps and play with your friends. This game is amazing,5
"Love this game, it reminds me a lot of back in the day playing COD with friends on Consoles. The only thing I wish they would bring in is an 'In-Game Task Tracker' where you can check your current task progress DURING a match :)",4
"This game is definitely the best fps game on mobile. But nowadays this game has become so irritating due to guns like na45,persistence , overpowered melee weapons, toxic players and also the game lags in respawn matches too much. Due to persistence, scorestreaks gets spammed at the second half of game and game lags drastically and is unplayable. Please remove persistence or make it so that it can't be used with hardline.",5
Very good game devs it's just perfection just one humble request please add the feature to set the HUD opacity to 0 instead of 10 it'll give a more realistic vibe to the game. And remember one thing whatever other games come out never gonna quit codm. That's allüòä,5
"As a paying customer, I'm fairly upset that I can't go one match without the app force closing. It doesn't matter if it's battle royale or multiplayer, every single time I srart a match, or when it's the clutchest of moments, the game force closes. This results in xp being deducted and a nice ban from ranked matches for a bit. It's a great game considering it's a mobile platform. But it's extremely buggy and laggy.",2
"People will always find something to complain about when it comes to gaming but I don't have a single complaint. The graphics are amazing and so are the weapons, operators and game modes. There's someone to do especially since there's also a br if you get bored of multiplayer. Its honestly an amazing app and if you're having any problems I might suggest upgrading your device because I haven't hit a single bug or glitch in this game. Amazing",5
"Now its kinda bad for me, its maybe because the type of device I have,but CODM has been trash on my thing and feels like its taking up a. Lot of space on my phone so if they can just fix that.another problem is that when I go to my load out or playing something it always turns black and sends me back to my home screen or just freezes my phone.I really be happy if actvion would fix that problem.But the game play is good.",3
"The game is excellent. I only have 2 problems with it, 1. The game is pretty laggy on the phone. Don't know why but it is. 2. Ever since I downloaded the most recent update I've been having problems with the mic. Sometimes it won't turn on and I can't hear my team or talk to them and other times it's perfectly fine. I've tried to get me cod friends to give me their discord info so we can talk but hardly anyone I play with checks their DMs so... But overall it's a great game",4
"I want to play, not wait ten minutes for it to load new features, which feels like everytime. Had a quick 10 minutes to waste, spent it loading this games update... actually I stopped it because I couldn't be bothered waiting. üòï",2
It keeps my mind going and relaxed especially coming up with new strategies.... and trying to be better than the next.... love how we can play at any any hours of the day or night.... one thing I dnt like it to spend money to level up.....,5
"Well gotta say It's 1 of the best games or the best one that I've played so far. It's a great game but it won't get along with a low end device very well which itself isn't s.th good you know, not so many people have good devices these days so if you have a low end device you should expect laging and freezing when you press that download button buddyüóø",5
"I love the game. I hope u guys can run this game better for low end people because we get frame drops and lag. I also hope u guys reduce the storage amount because I have low end, and it's sometimes hard to download new update but overall great game. I hope the next update size is low and other updates so that we all play well and don't have any frame drops or ping spikes all of that stuff love codm keep the good work up",5
"LOVE!! This is officially the Premier FPS on Mobile, and Hands down, I could not think of a way to make COD any more fun on a Mobile Platform. EVERYTHING you could want in a mobile COD, Perks, Leveling, Variety of Weapons and Loadouts... This ticks every box EDIT: BUT you can still P******F with your stupid adds that can't be muted. F-right off wiv that sht.",5
"Since my last absence from the game its improved slightly, however I tried the draw for an exclusive gun, what a RIP-OFF ¬£23:99, THEN ¬£23:99 AND THEN ¬£38:94 STILL NO GUN. No more will I waste money on these RIP-OFF game. Recently been experiencing a lot of hacked players and where it's easy to report them. NOTHING APPEARS TO BE GETTING DONE ABOUT THEM.",1
"Whats wrong with this game, I cant login at all. IT happened many times.. I uninstalled it then installed it again and play the game for like 3-5 days.. and cant login again .. repeated it for like 5 times.. Am so disappointed. The size is like 14 -15 Gb it si not meant to Reinstall over and over again",1
"After updating, the game was not working showing like ""Download configuration failed,make sure your device is connected to a network and restart the game"" again and again it's happening when my device network is very good why it's happening üò†üò†",1
"Thank you guys for such an amazing experience. Great game , amazing graphic quality , but has some flaws like taking much time to load , takes up alot of storage too Please see what you can do about the amount of storage this game alone takes up , thanks :)-",5
The last update completely nuked the game. Every time I try to log in I get a timeout message. I have to try like 10 times before I finally get through. Super Inconveniencing.,1
"I have been playing this game since May 2020 and it has been my favourite mobile game ever since. That's why it pains me to say that the game has become unbearably toxic, and unlike previous times, COD Devs are doing absolutely nothing about it. Full teams can spam persistence scorestreaks now, you can't do anything against melee abusers in SnD, and the game just isn't fun anymore. I wish you would actually listen to the community for once. Already looking for alternatives with my friends :(",1
"I love this game and I play it all the time but the fact that we have to update it almost every two months is tiring, I would love and prefer that the developers should work towards only in game update rather than always updating on play store and spending more. Please Activision, Timi studio and Tencent games, please work towards only in game development",4
"I have seen bad games. But this crosses all the limits of being bad. Worst graphics, worst gameplay, end number of glitches and the list goes on. Creators, if you are reading, please fix it.",1
"Started off great but, as with everything else, there are to many elitist fools on here with cheats like aim bot. If you don't spend money you don't get anywhere. There is no way someone with a sniper rifle can be faster than someone with a drawn pistol at close range. Then there's the stupid costumes........ running around in a Joker costume or looking like a tourist in Hawaii........ REALLY???? Get a grip for gods sake. Rapidly becoming boring which is a real shame... noticing a lot of cheats",2
Over the time this game has improved a lot. Yes some minor issues like big size and update size are large but then again this game presents players most modes and features along with beautiful graphics that a person can play on mobile. This game is far far better than other multi-player games on this platform. Love you guys and this game ‚ù§,5
"Every time I download an update, it exhaust double of the estimated file size, once it reaches 99% it hangs and starts again from the beginning, please fix this it's annoying",1
"For Newcomer you want to play this huge game follow this steps, you need 15gb of internet for complete download this game and for updating you need 10gb of internet every month useage and most important that you need a phone which has a 8 to 12 gb RAM with good ROM storage like 128 gb upto 1 tb or more that should be there in your phone then you can play this game nice and perfectly. That's why Call of duty mobile not popular in India.",1
"Unplayable due to lag and sync since recent update. Playing since codm launch. Reinstalled many times. Confirmed it's cod issue, as other games run fine. Game load speed has become lot slower. Time to start a game, is high - you have to go through multiple prompts/ADs. And after each game, you again have to go through multiple screens to play next game which is annoying. Responsiveness is slow. I hope the game gets simpler to play and less bloated. The game size is quite large(5GB+) as well.",2
Please make the game light it doesn't work properly some devices. I have one plus 5 device that has 8GB ram the game is to crossing 15 GB. When the rent in front of us the game is lagging or freeze for 5 to 8 seconds.,2
For the 2nd time the game won't load and I lose all game data. Very annoying when I get a good rating going. Hope someone will fix it.,1
No Doubt this game is awesome.... Its graphics are like realistic and codm is quite addictive also ... I personally like ranked game mode ... and its updates are also fantastic... but update size is so large which disappoints me every time .. :-),4
"I have been playing this game for a long time, and this game impressed me a lot. Its graphics and controls are much better than other games. It has many game modes that you can play. Many times this game gets readm codes, so that you can buy game expensive things without real money. So in my recomdation this game is the best game.",5
"This is the best game ever made in history of mobile games. Seriously this game has every thing you can imagine. Devs of codm gives us a lot of stuff every month new maps, new guns, new battle pass, character skins,new gun skins, new settings and lot I am really impressed with this game not every mobile game can do all this stuff. You guys are legends.",5
"Im enjoy it when it wasnt just tryhards hackers and bots But now im getting alot of bullet invailds and miss people at point blank range. Like im a Dlq quick scoper and i want my shot to hit at point blank range no go to narnia And the ""seeking equal players"" isnt fair because its either a bot or a tryhard lobby in ranked and I went to therapy twice with this. CODM just fix the point blank narnia bullets",3
"We need a african server how are we to compete against players with 20 ping and we stuck on over 100 ping, its not fair to every gamer out there, this will also fix the lag in the game. Its not a world championship cause only selected countries are allowed to progress further than stage 2, it should be called favoritism championship instead.",1
Playing this game since 2019 it never depress me up but sometimes fps drop while using some equipments sucks!! Good game good graphics and a entertaining one too Hackers needed to be kept away for being the perfect game there....,5
Gameplay is good but there are lot of errors like even when I am connected through good wifi connections it always giving me downloading errors and game doesn't even start Please fix that otherwise what's a benefit of having good game if it doesn't even start giving same kind of error again and again,2
"Best multiplayer fps on mobile. Period. Also, trying to get AK117 TIMEPIECE seasonal event and it won't count any more of my SMG kills past 16 (out of 25 needed), regardless of which SMG I use (I've played 2 matches each with 4 different SMGs and still hasn't budged, <<10-20 kills per match on average>> please fix lol!)",5
Good game but a few bad choices first ranked is filled with players using persistence so it's hard to win also so much lag and it's pay to win. Second the prizes for the world championship are bad as epic skins and look more like rare skins also some many players using meta weapons,3
"It was a great game except everytime I attempt to purchase cod points I constantly get ""billing service unavailable for this device""??? Why has this changed all of a sudden? An believe me I've tried EVERYTHING.",3
Update: I am very disappointed and how the tournament is played stuck with a team that doesn't want to play the tournament and now I'm screwed after all the hard work I went through to get to stage 2 to not be able to play the tournament. I think tournament should be removed because it's unfair to millions of players who can't play with a active team.,1
"Decrease the size of the game but it seems that 20gb of ram phone will have to be taken. The game seems to be fixed, it shoots, it goes somewhere else.",1
"Man, this game is fun and id give it 5stars but to get the cool skins u have to pay BIG. Random draws aren't random. The game gives u the trash and forces u to spend more to get the good rewards. Skins will cost u between $75-$125 before they allow u to ""random"" draw in the play store. Only part of the game I HATE. Not cool.",3
"The daily lucky draw (free rewards) and all crates are seriously rigged, can you include more cool items there as we repeatedly get the same stuff as duplicate items. Please fix this ASAP. Would be great if there's Google Play account integration. Hoping to see more new maps in battle royale & cross platform gaming soon. Please include night mode maps ASAP in both BR & MP. Some weapons don't have enough ammo, like Rocket Launchers, Crossbow, etc. Request you to implement the changes ASAP.",4
"Huge disadvantages with every update, while I lag my way thru the map, pay 4 play guy zig Zags around me while sliding and hip firing at 100% accuracy... unplayable without a controller and paid upgraded guns. Older version was better.",1
What a joke of a game full of bots I've just come out of a game and my hole team where just running in circles so you end up trying to play 1 vs five then you lose loads of points this is not on. People have cheats so just kill u anywhere in the game only good thing is the graphics. It's a war game you don't have dogs and you shouldn't lose points if it's 2 vs 5 that's unfair seriously sort it out and sort your game out. Will not recommend it to my friends to play,1
"Settings in the game, say that a PS5 controller is supported. So, I went and bought a $75 PS5 controller. PS5 controller is NOT suppoerted. I then purchased a PS4 controller. The PS4 controller works fine. UPDATE YOUR GAME TO SUPPORT THE NEW!!! And now anybody that uses a controller can't join ranked matched.",1
"Hi, I tried to login to the game and I'm not able to get my profile which was at lvl 150. The game started at level 1 as guest login. It's not allowing me to login with my Google login(my current account) which I was using till yesterday night. Kindly look into the matter with earliest response . Thanks Ryan",1
"This game is awsome, I like playing it its just so fun. I qalified for the champions 2 times (Multiplayer) I have been legendary on battle royal 4 times. On Multiplayer it has so much maps that you could choose from to play at, on battle royal it starts the game by a count down and you look on map to see where you want to go. Check out this awsome game its fun, Call Of Duty Mobile ( COD M) Made by: @LOKO Instagram loko_izzy_vm",5
"The recent updates a disappointment. The controller Bluetooth connectivity is worse. The bots are a literal waste of time especially in search and destroy when they are slide jumping across the map away from objective gameplay. The bots are point feeders in Frontline and tdm. Then during kill cams, you see them aiming directly at the opponent but the bullets nerf after they wound them. And the random draws are sadly biased to backpacks and flashbangs... this game suffers from capitalist greed",2
"The last update has broken the controller support. I have played with PS4 controller about long time but with this update I can't use the left and right stick's, only the buttons works. Please fix it Asap.",1
It is an amazing game graphics are spot on and the customization is amazing but the only thing that's keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that some of the guns are way to overpowered but other than that it's an amazing spectacular game,4
Game controls are legit.. game modes and map play are the best I have seen on a mobile app only one issue if I play a ranked match I get booted. Not allowing to play it again for several minutes,5
"Great fun , I have been with it since the beginning and witnessed it evolving into a stunning mobile game yet to be rivaled. At present it comes in at 15GB so make sure you have the space on your device. Give it a try and prepare to be wowed.",5
"I absolutely love this game. The graphics, plays smooth, great sound, but can you please update the game and give us a lobby for higher ranked players such as grand masters and higher ranks so it doesn't take us over an hour to find a dang ranked match.",5
Best shooting game. With realistic graphic and physics.... But they should do something for space management. With every new update it means plus 2-1GB. That's not good.,3
Why the app is not taking FB login on WiFi or mobile data network..just throwing error message. Have tried reinstalling the game but every time same network error message Have tried with different WiFi networks as well as mobile data network. But same issue..fix it ASAP,1
This is my favorite game if it is compared with other games it is 100x better than the games but it has only 1 mistake it takes too much space so low end mobiles can't download it like it takes 10 GB! Space in my mobile that's why I have given 4 stars.,4
"Still the BEST fps game on mobile, but these ""seasons"" just get lazier and lazier. All they do is port guns from the console games and slap on some basic, cheap weapon skins to grind for. Plus the game is like 8 gigabytes now, it's just ridiculous I'm moving to cloud gaming",3
I have been trying to update the app from the playstore for days now it doesn't work...it will download and and won't install just consuming my data and money..I had to reset my phone thinking its from the oho.e but as at now still...you should make the download available elsewhere so that if we face problems likethiswe can refer to those sources...,1
"I have been enjoying this game when i cant play on the console, so im not sure why this game has been kicking me off completely... Like it just shuts off and im at the homescreen of my phone.... And its worse when im in rank match because me leaving a match gets a penalty and some points taken out my rank... May you please fix this because this is ridiculous... Its been like this for a while and im at the point of removing it since i cant enjoy it...",2
"Ok this game is so good and I really like it, I'm at level 35 now. But since yesterday I can't get in the game! Well I tried logging in with my email multiple times but it says that my email or password is invalid and I'm sure that I'm logging in with the right email & password. What should I do now?! It seems like all the game I've played just disappeared! And I'm not happy about that..",3
"Great game, been playing it for a while now, since it actually came out first with the occasional breakes here and there. 5/5 however there are still things the developers could do, mainly like making it able to Rename your clan because the bug has been persisting for ages now. Best of luck!",5
"I enjoyed this game a lot. This game is very much like csgo, valorant and stuff. Just a recommendation. I request you to add a feature that if we click the reload button with the gun full, there would be a weapon inspection.",5
"Changed Review: its fantastic & gives military vibe.. only some problem like login errors & too much size needed. Maps, in-game update, HD quality update, skin download & what not. Plz reduce a little bit & it will surpass pubg in no time",3
"PUT A PERMANENT OPTION NOT TO PLAY WITH CONTROL PLAYS!! Are you looking for a game with full of cheating and controller players that have nothing to do about thumbs on glass. This is the game for you. When Level 10-15 are getting 10,000 points there is a serious problem!! Do your Job and get rid of these people.",1
Very well made game simple controls console level next gen graphics hoping battle will get the same graphics as multiplayer but outside that enjoyable and entertaining experience! worth even trying! Deserves 5 stars and number 1 of the best mobile shooter game that includes featured graphics gameplay and details! Along with customizable controls. But the bad side of the game is it takes too much storage space. Example: downloading skins and maps. Hope you consider my suggestion and fix this.,5
"I a a loyal player to this game and playing on my OnePlus 9RT, Now I am having issues when I try to open & gave me error that Download failed...etc, I uninstalled this game & installed again but the same issue is there, When I can download the game on the same network then why the issue is to open the game? What kind of update you guys are providing to us as we are unable to open. Need senior intervention to solve this issue ASAP.",1
"Game is garbage now. It seems that no device is capable of keeping the app running. The app keeps crashing. Everytime they update, the app has problems running right. No matter how much you complain, nothing gets done about the problems. So I recommend that no one download this game and definitely don't purchase anything",1
"You can't use PS4 controllers anymore, which makes no sense as I literally used it to play the other day, I don't understand why ou need to change something that isn't broken !!!!!!!!!! Uninstalling now and finding something else to play, thanks Activision, retards",1
"Aye great game! Just one small problem... MY GRAPHICS ARE STUCK AT LOW! I downloaded the HD graphics but alas, my graphics still resemble Doom... For the love of god,guns, and games, tell me how I fix this.",5
I love this game it is just awesome it is so cool and has a lot of guns. Just the best game EVER. It has become a very swetty game since the last time I updated this thing I and it is really bad with skill base match making. Like for instance I am grandmaster 1 then I get thrown in to legendary lobys it really sucks Activision. Pls correct that.,4
"Its good BUT i want to log back in with facebook because i have all my saved progress in it e.g high level guns but when i click on ""sign in with facebook"" it gives me an ""authorisation error"" plz fix this i dont want everything lost.",4
I've tried many mobile shooter games and none can compete with codm. Many other games would have glitches with gravity and unrealistic graphics. For example in some games if a car would bump into some high up place that is hard to reach and it will start teleporting up and down. It can't find a surface. In codm every place is made with realistic rules of a science and unpassable walls exc.,5
"For one, 10 cartridges in the head are enough for another and 120 is not enough, the damage does not regrow at all. Thank you of course for the optimization, but nothing has changed with the registration of damage, the Internet is normal, the smartphone is normal, and the game has remained as it was for a while.",1
"Need help please, Galaxy note 10+ did a system update to Android 11 and now this game gives me a white screen and closes during matches now. I have tons n tons of memory left. Is something not compatible after update? This is my go to game to play. Please let me know how to fix this issue. Thank you Update: fixed",5
I love this game and it's good to see that developer's are constantly trying to bring something new in every season. It will be great if Activision starts collaboration events and crossover it will be a super fun to play.,5
"I've been playing this game ever since it was launched, it has awesome graphics so much like a real life feature but there's one problem is that we have to pay money to be able to get cp points why don't you do like an event for once to be able to get some cp in like a 1v1 fight or something like that and when this happens it will become a 5 stars",4
"Everyone misses the old zombies, be great if you could bring it back instead of Siege. Gameplay and everything else is great though, but to get a 5/5, bring back the original zombies.",4
"The graphics looks even better than pubgüî•!!!so I started lovingü•∞ this game. there are so many guns, my favourite gun is ""TYPE-25"". The best feature of this game is : scope before shooting. The maps are awesomeüëåü§©. I would like to give it five stars‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê. This is the best game in the worldüåç.",5
"Overall, the game itself is great. The controls and gameplay are fun and well developed, the amount of customization is huge, and the graphics are pretty good. There are tons of cool maps and skins, and several fun modes. But there are problems. Hackers and people who p2w are everywhere, there are smurfs in every single game, and it's just not fun to play anymore. If you're not amazing at the game, or if you dont play on keyboard and mouse, it's nearly impossible to win.",2
"it's a cool game to play but with recent updates it's giving me hell, it keeps crashing and lagging, and the updates are insane, there is an update every 10 days and with every update the game becomes worse.",3
Good game play and all but really really dude you need to unlock the graphics so kids will make your name is high quality and who it takes everyday on the things and your game hasn't crashing and crashing okay so I'm just going to say every time and go on the phone it ain't no ain't no no across the class is about the times until I access it from once my life doing it again so so fix that problem now I'm not playing your game I want I want to play it on a console instead and I fix it you lazy id,1
It's the best stress buster game I have ever come across. I would someday like to own the PS4 version of this game and play it on the big screen as well. Really great graphics and controls.,5
"Worst game ever, it's a pay to win game. If you have a paid skin of gun and paid character then you are pretty much invincible. You have to spend thousands of cod points just to buy a gun from Lucky Draw and the other things like charms, calling card, stickers etc are pretty much useless who cares about the tiny charm you made when they are just shooting at the enemy. Legendary and mythic guns are just cheats it has zero recoil, six attachment and already has a red dot sight attached.",1
"I've played this on various phones from iPhone to Samsung to Lg and it never disappoints me. There are some minor bugs and crashes nothing to bad. Honestly for this being a mobile game it competes with actual ps, Xbox and PC games. My humble opinion. 4.7‚òÜ only because of the small occasional crashes and the times it takes for ever to find a match.",5
This game is best. Best graphics on low settings also. No ping problem occured. We can get best FPS in the game. Frame drop doesn't occur. And the best thing is there are no hackers. I have played many matches and still playing but no hackers are occured till now and I think in future also no hacker will occur.,1
Having a major issue. Call of Duty championship 2022 is on and I already qualified for the second round. Now I get screwed because my teammates leave and I get a sad sad consolation prize and a loss on the championship. Some consolation prize for competing 5 v 1 thanks a whole lot.,3
"Game was nice before . But nowadays it takes almost 7-8 restarts to ...start the game . Dont know why , everytime it shows , "" download configuration failed , mobile not connected to network"" , where my mobile is always connected to best 4G broadband .",2
"I used to love COD and even CODM but after the last couple of updates the glitches,crashing, and hackers just make CODM no fun to play anymore!!!! Which is the purpose of games right??? Seems to me CODM only cares about the money it can swindle ppl out of and not the customers them selves.... If your looking for a fun game keep looking this isn't it!!!!!!",1
"I'm not allowed to play anytime since I updated the game, the game is cutting few seconds after a selected parted then the sever/system will disqualify me. I appeal you setting the sever to normal. Thank you.",1
Everytime I want to play call of duty it tells me timeout before i can even log in and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my wifi. Can i please get a feed back on this. Overall i love this game i play on a daily basis. But with i am receiving problems just after the latest update,3
"This is my favorite mobile game, I've been playing almost since it comes here in Playstore. But recently some adaptations let me down a lot, I always play as a sniper and I can't see enemies from a distance anymore and sometimes even in medium distance they just run away and disappear. I truly love the game but it's not like it used to be anymore üòî (but I loved the scope thing, it's so much clear to see!!!)",3
"I love the game, if it's true that in optimization issues it lags behind compared to other shooters but it has very good graphics and every GB you download is totally worth it!",3
If you love to play a FPP game then it's the Best game for you But now I am unable to play it. Every time it is showing that the device is not connected with Internet Connection... But My Device is already connected with Wifi... And by using it I just have download the game again... But everytime it shows download connection failed... Why ???,1
I used to love this game but now I am unable to even open it!! I don't know why but it keeps saying that download configuration failed. Please connect to a network and restart game. I have already connect to wifi and all other online games are working but I don't know what the problem is here. Can u pls help or fix it,2
"Impossible to play if you have a low end device. Too much to download and things don't render. You have to download files thats more than your phone storage. You have to download a file for high quality audio, it's not included?? I feel this should accessible to everyone who wants to play and wants to go pro. Also, when the new season starts your rank goes back too far. I was literally Grand Master III and I logged in boom I'm Pro I, instead of bringing people back two ranks, it should be one.",2
"I love the game but I have just a little request. I'm wondering if you could just add a few pistols, like you did with the Desert Eagle and the Beretta M9A3. You could add like an HK USP or a Glock 17 or 18C and the Sig Sauer P226 is a must in all shooting games since is a legendary pistol that was also used by the Marines. Other than this the game is awesome and I love it. Good job!",5
"Game is fine right now, but used to be better. Back when this game first came out it was a great light mobile version of cod, the battles were fun and relatively easy to play and win. Now there is so many sweats and bots it's a joke. This game kinda turned out how fortnite turned out, anywho its still enjoyable at times.",3
It is a very good game but when I restarted my phone one time and I tried to play it it want me to login to my account so I put in my email and password but it says it's rong so I try a couple of different passwords that might be right and non of the work so I try to change e my password but it never sends me the email it says it should so I haven't been able to play it for a really long time and so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars,2
"I love the game play experience, I have been playing it on my A52s 5g and I have never had issues, though playing on max settings makes the phone heat up. One of the best games on mobile I have played in years.",5
It's a cool game for sure despite some gameplay glitches performance is decent enough. Tough on free players no way to earn CP gold. And huge file 10gbs takes up a lot of space! And uses 1gb of ram to run but fun game for sure!,4
I'm getting real tired of getting kicked off game for some reason I can't dog out is not my internet but happens more then once every time I play I've spent a lot of money on this game it really sucks wish I could fix it I've tried reinstalling it any ideas???,1
"I'm using phone running under Android 12 and sd 695, yet the game keeps on crashing and suffers frame drop( lag ) even under medium graphics and Max frame rate. I have been playing this game for about 1 year and started experiencing this issue after this update. Looking forward for a fix. This issue issue sucks off my patience.",1
"Does anyone else get respawned on mines, in fires, or in front of gatling guns. It just happened to me over five times I died from the middle point of the game all the way to the end instantaneous death. It sucked.",4
"Great game, best online multiplayer game in my opinion! However I do have a suggestion: Make it to where there's an option to download friends character skins, gun skins, vehicle skins, etc.",4
Well maybe this will get some attention. I love this game. Played it for several years now. I even had a clan with 65 members on it. Then a few days ago I'm suddenly banned for 10 years. Can't sign in to Activision account to find out why because I signed in to the game with Facebook. When I use the same email to create an account ut says I'm not banned but I am. Very upset about what happened and cannot get any help from Activision.,1
"üëçüëç Good Game, Good Job all around with this game!!! I do not say that lightly especially considering the quality and control the gameplay gives you from a mobile device platform, with virtually no issues a mobile device tends to give you with a game this emmence... Again Good Game and Good Job üëçüëç",5
"Game for losers..equality does not exist.. PG in these circumstances is much better. It's only bad if you have a bad internet connection. Go to PubG if y want relax and play When you are too strong, they intentionally make you slower .. it feels more accentuated in the fight for rating ... the escape is to delete the game completely and reinstall it ... so when you play back they will give you the equality. So you can play a few rounds and feel like you're moving freely, fast, easy and after a few rounds it's like you're fat and slow you run and slowly you turn around, slowly you move your weapon ... but nothing has changed in parameters or internet quality. .. they give priority to those who bought skills or weapons ... PG in these circumstances is much better. It's only bad if you have a bad internet connection. Real weapons, not invented ... like CODE, to attract as much money as possible.",1
"Great game but screw Activision, the game has rigged matchmaking, new guns with legendary skins get boosted, please nerf the shotguns, melee is overpowered and constantly abused, honestly I am very good at the game but the AI's in the game always get matched to my team since I am free 2 play, so they don't have brains, I play with a shotgun, go to push and the bots don't follow or support, im constantly 1v3 and it kills my kd, the game is great, but Activision sucks.",3
"All have has a been nice playing this game I recommend it, minus all the possibilities of cheaters but that's just my opinion, spend your money if you want people nothing wrong with a app that only gives you small things in return. Don't ever except them to invest in you. But maybe one day they will.",2
The game is absolutely amazing but the br version needs some changes and they have to nerf the clown ability of summoning zombies they are difficult to kill including the person who used that ability the multiplayer mode is insane i loved that,5
"Good game but needs improvement, for instance it force's you to update immediately or you can't play, it lags way to much,and you can't play without perfect internet!!! Please fix!",3
"All in all a decent game. Meta weapons are too strong though, forces you to play a select few or get rekt. Battle royale is 80% bots which sucks, they opted for shorter queues than real pvp I guess. Unrated multiplayer also gives you at least 2 bots per team that get 1-3 kills each. Skins are nice and you can get many for little money if you spend it right(except for legendarys)",3
App crashes in the middle of a round. Just did it twice in battle royale. I've cleared cache and everything you say to do. Fix your game. Smh I keep losing battle royales because it's keeps crashing. This is getting ridiculous! üò°üò°,1
I've been installing this game over and over but it keeps telling me I don't have enough storage even though I've deleted every app on my device. And I have enough space to download apps that are larger than it. Please help I really want my account back so I can play again.,1
This great but there is a couple problems... it chooses all the worst players ever to be on my team and it lags at literally the worst times ever. I was gonna say this was super impossible but that is a player problem. And please make it so hacking is impossible because there is a 1 million percent chance the enemy team is hacking. Update: I don't think there are any admins that are sane so please fire the insane admins and hire some sane ones,4
Game's graphics are like pc games and there are lot of guns and modes to choose from But the only thing that is making this game unplayable is definitely persistence I mean I rarely do a gunfight while half match is only done by scorestreaks and utilities,3
"It's really good for a mobile game, which all the maps, guns, and things to do. But I rate this at 4 stars for the reason of storage. But other than the storage it's a really good game üôÇ",4
What the f*** is with this game my game was going awesome but when I was running towards the safe zone at that time the game laged but after that the game minimised on its own whhhyyy and also i have a word glitch i am not able to read words because they are disappeared. Repair my problems or else i will delete my account permanently,3
"Love this game. Keeps me sharp on the road. But a couple of days ago my account was hacked. I am able to get in, but whomever is doing this has purchased and used all my CoD coins, changing my setup and gear and has changed my name. I need someone to reach out to me asap. I need help.",5
"I love this game, the updates are getting ridiculous. I'm updating review, due to the amount of updates and storage space this game is taking. The updates should be OPTIONAL for users who are not even playing those games modes. üôÑ 6.48gb just for this app alone. The game modes that we like keep getting removed. Capture the flag keeps getting removed which should be permanent and 10vs10. Like why should I have to be subject to 348 my for every update and it changes nothing about multi-player mode",2
"Great app! But the match making is broken.. Random teammates destroy the experience.. they are terribly bad, worst than bots, so after 2 years of playing every day I'm fed up. I'm not playing anymore. If teamates would be decent at least i would be playing.. but i have downloaded 2 different games,and I like them so much that maked me absolutely forget about codm. Well done Activision. You're random matching sistem is terrible.. and you going to loose all you're users. Congratulations:))",5
It's a pretty good game I personally bought the past and most recent battle passes and I love then but I think there should be more to get with out the pass for players who can not spend money on the game sometimes it's challenges are a bit weak and sometimes way to hard to the point where it's not worth the reward but over all it's a balanced game you don't have to make a purchase to enjoy the game but it definitely adds to the experience.,5
"Maybe it's just my phone, but it crashes at least once every hour. I'm in ranked matches which sucks because I get pentalized everytime the game crashes like if it's my fault. Sometimes when I'm playing BR it crashes too and that also sucks. Everytime I open the app right away to get back, but it takes so long to load, so sometimes I can't get back to the game which they penalize me for and I lose the work I was putting in to complete tasks. Besides that the game is awesome. Thank you!",3
Can you fix this app where it won't keep kicking me out a lot when i try to download the in game content please i like the game but it makes me not want to play it every single time i try to download it will download sometimes a lot some time barely anything i keep have to log back in again and again,1
"Solve the network connectivity issue ! I am able to use all social media platforms and other online stuffs, the game stucks while playing, shows network error in between match ! Do something about that ! There is no issue from my phone !",2
"Very entertaining game. It's good to be able to connect with friends without stress. Y'all should try to provide an avenue for people to get free CPs too, it should give people more reason to play the game.",3
Its a great game and i used to enjoy it Untill it started freezing the whole time Whenever i open the game thhe internet drops and the worst is that the freeze comes only when am about to shoot an enemy and suddenly am dead It starts since 3 updates and all the time u update but not fix the bug Please fix it or i'll have to join another,5
"The game is nice. But for every update it takes around 1.2gb+ of my daily data. And it is also required to re-download all of the previous resources which I have downloaded. Please fix this. And for other feedbacks, it's ok. Thank You.",4
It's the second time I've tried updating to season 5... And another 1.5gb wasted because when I'm done downloading it's keeps showing some other download ongoing.. and then it's stops and asks me to update again.. I'm tired,1
Im loving it so far. Helps with the boredom thru these times. Haven't been able to start up game. Have to uninstall and download again and we all know how long it takes to download the extra content. And I have 5g wifi. Was enjoying up until now.,1
"WHY CANT I LOGIN !!! EVWRYTIME I ENTER MY Login details it keeps on saying timeout .... I have Data and good internet ,space and my phone runs on a 4GB ram help me understand why It keeps timing out ,I even uninstalled and reinstalled it ,I played two games and got off the app and have been trying to reconnect but it keeps timing out ,what's the problem ?",1
"Not only do the devs ignore any feedback given to them, they also go against what the majority of the playerbase wants by removing fun modes like Zombies, Alcatraz, etc. Do not expect fun modes out of this game at all times, everything remotely interesting is only there for a couple days every few months.",1
Would it be too much to ask for more realistic and badass weapon and operator skins? Everything lately has been super bright neon colors (which are terrible for not being seen by enemies) or just childish looking garbage.,3
"Every couple of week I leave a new review talking about how broken this game is and every time it just gets removed and I have to rewrite it. The matchmaking is terrible, every match up has 4 people at a higher tier than your whole squad. Once you hit Grandmaster all you'll play against is AI's that kill you with one bullet. I've got so many recordings of bots taking out 2-4 people with 2-4 rounds it's so ridiculous. CoD gets worse and worse every year.",1
"This last update is absolutely horrible. I have no idea what the developers were thinking. After game stats are now some stupid ""ranking"" system that doesn't actually provide any actual post game information. I'm incredibly disappointed with this update and hope that the developers do something to fix this.",1
"Great game to play! Has lots of load out options. You can join a clan and it gives you benefits. Some issues: needs lots of storage, have to download lots of stuff that interrupts the game a lot, and it changes quite a bit.",3
"I want y'all to take care of the things which we want.... Devs y'all r getting into my nerves soon ull lose ur place if it goes on. About the update I haven't done yet, but I'm shore it has some fixes, pros and cons, buffs and nerfs. What u need to do is listen to us and make the game Player Friendly. I've been receivin many issues regarding this, but none of u r interested in solving it. The game's becoming big by every update, whereas a trash game like Free Fire is gainin popularity ‚òòÔ∏èü§û",2
So big it takes all my phones storage cant delete resources cant delete zombies. Uninstalled the game started downloads for everything but undead map and it stopped all the map downloads to download zombies. i dont play zombies ever. Why do you force people to download it. If i uninstall again itll be for good.,2
Updates are almost as large as the game and every couple of weeks trust me your phone will fill up fast especially since almost every update means redownload maps and weapons absolutely ridiculous that they can't figure it out.,2
Ive been playing this game for five years and I swear this is damn near better then the console!!! I even went and bought a hand held controller üéÆ for my phone. Best game in the apple store as well as goole store!!!!! I got 60k kills with 3.5 kill to death ratio. I am in love with this game üéØ,5
..... Best mobile game out there!!! Make it better by putting an offline single player bot mode for those who dont always have access to wifi!?!?!! Kinda like a practice mode offline?? Just an idea! Maybe with some objectives to complete? Maybe try to lower how big the download size of the game is??,4
A totally extreme game! Loved every nook and corner of it. Makes the game really worth it. I will recommend it for any player who is wanting to play a game with realistic and high graphics. A zillion times better than free fire amd PUBG as it has both 1st person and third person templates. If i can I will give it 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars. Download the game and give it a test at maximum graphics and you will see the extreme hardwork of activision.,5
"This game has gone from good to worst since the past two months I've been unable to play the game it keeps freezing and it's Soo annoying I guess they are overloading it with too much BS, this should be fixed please for now I'm deleting the game, cause I deleted and reinstalled it before thinking the freezing would stop but it didn't so till it's fixed I won't be playing the game.",1
Can u guys add like a adrenaline shot that heals the player outside the zone. Cause if you get caught in a fight outside the zone and end up on a low health. There is no way you are gonna survive.. so if u add an fast heal shot like that only for health its gonna help a lot.. just like gas mask in warzone.. also lot of fps drop even on my 8gb ram phone .,3
I am not able to login using my wi-fi. On mobile data it is working fine but not on wifi; it shows network error. And what is funny my brother is always playing alongside me using the same wifi. Fix the issue asap. I am not liking it and i love COD.ü•∫üò≠,5
"My boyfriend got me hooked on playing COD mobile. Its been a lot of fun. These past two days though, when i play any mode, when im moving around, it keeps stopping and freezing me. Ive redownloaded it and everything and it hasnt fixed it. If you guys can fix, that would be fan-freaking-tastic.",5
I love the game from I first heard of it because I have played almost every call of duty and I have never had problem with none of these but I wish they bring back the kilo 141 demon song but just lag in some parts where shots don't hit the enemies or you get where your moving and no one else is,5
"A really fun game to play and pass time, only problem is that there's this weird bug that started with season 3 this year. Whenever I try to log into a game and play I will repeatedly get kicked from the app completely. I haven't had this problem until season 3 came around. Please fix this issue as I'm not the only person experiencing it.",3
Best Graphics and Very best controllers very good FPS for 8 GB ram and mediatek dimesity 1200 and Snapdragon 8 gen 1 it will give max 100+ fps approximately if you also have a good processor on. shooting experience quality will be lit. If any one reads bad review about glitch and lags of this game the person might not have stable or low RAM mobile to run the game. Otherwise game is very awesome. Except I just want to say CoD M that please fix in game playing GPU lag issues otherwise game is OP,5
"I've been playing this game for a long time and have never had a problem with it up until recently when I can't even join a game without either lagging out of the match or just continuously lagging while in the match. I thought it might of been my wifi connection but in game it says my wifi connection is great and also on my phone, I really don't want to have to delete the game just because of this, I just really want this fixed whatever this is.",1
This game is insanely fun it is a perfect mish mash of all of the call of duty games with weapons and maps from almost all of the games in the franshise and has hours of replay ability but because it is such a large game for mobile the loading times and lag dose ruin the emersion a bit. (I know the devs can't do anything about this. ) it would be a five star if it wasn't for the loading times and lag thank you.,4
Quick on the draw is what this game is about I am quicker on the draw but for some reason my bullets take 3 seconds to register so I hit somebody with a full clip and it as long as I don't get hit in the next three seconds I'll kill them but I have a disadvantage and I want to know why. Why do my bullets take 3 seconds to hit somebody? Am I being hacked? Does this happen to anyone else?,1
The game is pretty good and I have been playing int for over a year now.howere the problem is the the game is not optimiser for my phone. I can play other AAA games at the highest frame rate which is 60fps however this game doesn't let me go above high frame rate setting ans as you know frame rate is key when it comes to fps games so please cod mobile optimize the game for my phone cause it's getting frustrating :( Ps my phone is honor play 2018 model,2
Had to take 4 stars away because ever since the last update the game hardly ever loads. About to be done for good with this one. Every time there's an update it comes with issues lately.,3
"The best game I have ever played,finally fixing things,getting way better with that,bringing back the OGS.Love the redux draws.You guys look like your finally getting back to where you were but like with every game you have your ups and downs and you guys are getting up from a big down and if you keep going you'll soar above the competition.Keep it up.You won't find a game out their that has had this much of an impact especially when you watch FERG and the rest,PEACE.",5
Game is lagging after recent update there is big network issue .frames drops are too much and network problem I am using 4g+ fix the problem I am going to quit Playing cod of these recent update.....I am quitting network issue is to much. ..i like cod but not now,4
the game is amazing BUT you can't see someone else's unique clothes. It shows up as a plain guy. It's not OK bcs I paid money to have my unique skin and my teammates or other people playing can't even see it. So what's the point? PLEASE change so that everyone's unique uniform/skin is visible when playing without having to do anything. Can you fix it please,3
"Game is great, but the notifications are super annoying. I've disabled then at least once a day and still pushing through. Deleting app.",3
"Nothing to say, really. I love call of duty and ever since my brother broke my tv, I wasnt able to play call of duty until I remembered that I have it on my phone. 10/10, never seen a single hacker, mainly because it's a mobile game, so it's too hard to make hacks for. Best mobile app I've ever played. Thanks for this masterpiece, as soon as I saw the ad, I wanted to install it. Edit: where old zombies",5
"I got logged out due to an error in connection and now it keeps telling me login time out. I uninstalled it and re installed it, it worked quite alright and suddenly I got logged out and I'm unable to login. It keeps saying login timeout. How do I fix this. I'm really pissed right now",1
I feel like the game itself is great but there's two major problems once the crazy amount of gigabytes especially for this tablet and I literally just deleted it like a few hours ago for my YouTube videos and I brought it back and G's it is taking like two years to like download and overall I love cod is my childhood but man they really need to fix it,3
When I am playing any match then the ping randomly goes to 200 for 30 seconds then I die and I know it isn't my phone. I have the Galaxy S22+ and on my previous phone I could play just fine with the wifi in my house. Please fix this bug so I can play or I might go to apex,1
I am unable to download the new update. I downloaded it twice but it freezes at 100 percentage and doesn't installs... This is very annoying.,4
"This game has been steadily going down hill! The Lucky draws don't give you half of the tickets for watching the ads!! I have watched Dozens of ads, and haven't received 1/3 of the draws. I'm so close to quitting this game, it's ridiculous!",2
"This game was a good one, but after some time of playing it become worst game in the world, in case you reaching some higher level its become so hard to play, the enemies become immortal, you even can't kill a one person during game, so i think I'm gonna quite this stupid game, and one more bug, there are some weapons if you buy it you can kill anybody with any distance only with one bullet, so its terrabe and annoying",1
"Include more maps in ""Attack of the Undead"" mode. It's one of the best games, but limited by the maps one can play on.",3
"Fun game with amazing physics,the nerfs are questionable aswell as the buffs, amazing experience if your bored but want some pushing on the go if graphics aren't the most important thing, not the best but not the worst graphics for a mobile f2p game coming from a former top 1000 player I have alot of experience with the game",5
I have reduced the rating from 5 to 2 stars just because of the worst new update. In middle of every match it says wifi connection time out but my wifi is perfect. There is no problem in my wifi but in this new update it always shows this problem and disconnects me from the match in middle. Please fix it or i will leave the game,5
I used to enjoy this game but every time an update comes it needs more dataü§¨.my WiFi is excellent but this game demands more.codm has changed since last year and is getting frustrating.i used to rate it a five star but no more.üíîüòÖbut don't worry I still like it and I'm not deleting it.codmüíîüß°,3
"Favorite game; however, completely tired of updating and downloading. (COD was based on realistic play originally. I'm tired of all the fantasy characters and play) the downloads and updates should be a once a year ordeal. I don't play anything but MP and BR. I don't need all this extra paraphernalia weighing down my phone storage. Just keep it simple and enjoyable. Maybe a separate app for basic play and an app for all the other rooms. Fix it Activision!",3
"Please stop the auto downloading when connected to the Wi-Fi. Already checked the auto download option, and it is not enabled. But still everything is downloading. No problem when using mobile data. Please fix this",5
I like the game and graphics and everything but controls are also ok but sometimes there are glitches and some bugs like I cannot shoot. But now I cannot play the game It says that( you do not have an internet connection when you have an good internet connection please restart the game) so I cannot play the game please fix this I love playing Call Of Duty‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è so please‚Åµ fix this,4
This game is amazing. Being an Ov player there are certain things that are extremely good and some not. The revamp of the healing system effected many player's gameplay. The gunsmith is too wide. Overall great game BUT still love the OG one,3
"The game is really cool, I mean I've been playing for 3 years now and honestly I can say it's really great, but recently like I mean 17 hours ago I tried logging into my account and I couldn't, I've been trying ever since but I still can log in, can someone please tell me or assist me on how I can log back into my game",4
"The game is really good and runs well even on low end phones but depending on internet the game can become very laggy. The shooting button is in an area where it is very easy to misclick because there are several buttons very close to it. This game gets way too many updates like updates are fine but when its another 1gb ""update"" every single day that changes literally nothing it gets old",3
"This best game to play with best guy friends we've never had so much fun playing my favorite call of duty games because I only play call of duty ghosts, but now I have this call of duty I can play with my friends. Keeps crashing when updating at 100% idk what to do about it.",4
fun game but updates too much seem like everytime I update it takes up more storage miss the first version everything was simple a 5 star game that takes up too much data and updates far too often also too many adds and no point in playing if not in THE BEST wifi and can we go back to kill count instead of rating that's so dumb,3
"Yes Activision please don't give me any epic crate b'coz a lot of time, a lot of time I opened that crate and you still give me only duplicate items. And also I am not as lucky as you think in lucky draw crate. How I was spend money? Too much money I was paid. And please check my transaction b'coz I gave too much money for any transaction that I had did. Activision please solve that. I hope that you getting it seriously. So now I am giving you only 2 Star.",2
This game is fun and addictive but requires a lot of ram to function properly it lags very much when I'm playing BR especially in the final zone multi player is fun and the best to play until you get all bots in your team. So many issue need fixing I hope they improve it,3
I am having so much trouble logging into the game and it showing network error(4A28) again and again this was my favourite game and now I can't play it anymore. Otherwise the game is very good.,3
No idea what's going on. After every update my cod account is deleted. I even try forgot password and never receive an email to recover it. I have spent plenty of extra money on this game and might just delete it I'm tired of starting over.,2
This is a great game. I've lost everything twice when logging in with my email and as a guest. I would strongly suggest making a call of duty account.,4
It was good at first... Then the glitches.... And I made a mistake to update after the game refuse to let play anymore.... Now I can't play at all no matter what I do.... And it's really unfair after working hard to reach such a high level..... I'm gonna delete,1
"Fun game, the best shooter system I've seen on Mobile. My only problem with gameplay is that in advanced controls, the fire button acts as an aiming joystick. The only problem is that the button stays in the same place, making me need to adjust for where my gun went whenever I start shooting. If this is changed I would have any gameplay problems.",3
"So I been playing the game since pretty much the beginning, had my account connected with Facebook now all the sudden I can't login anymore. And there's literally no way to reach CoDM about the issue. No support system. Everything just gone. great work idiots",1
"Hello, I have been playing this game for last 2 year,it had been the best experience I have ever ,but from last few days it's been laging Whenever I enter in game after ever 1 minute, it keeps laging for 5 to 10 sec Please solve this problem,I am the regular player of call of duty mobile and I am fond of codm . Solve this problem immediately, either I play anther game.ok Consider this problem please.........",1
"Great game when it first came out. Now it has to many fantasy weapons that discredits the original concept of the game. When it first came out, I gave it 5 stars. Not anymore. I still get MVP more often than not, but the fantasy weapons have sucked the fun out of it.",1
Now this is called CODM. And please add the peek system... üòä I love this game but can't wait that if Activision add a new map to the game... Love This...üíô. Please add more servers for better pings in pakistan and other countries... And also add more BR maps I am playing PUBG M now because CODM is lagging too much on my smartphone (4GB RAM)... so please make it smoother...,5
"Really happy with the game, I've played a few times. But recently I've noticed that my PS4 controller won't work properly. It'll connect. But my right joystick won't work and none of the buttons are configured properly. I'd play normally, but my screen is cracked and I find it easier to play with a controller. Please fix soon.",3
"MOST ANNOYING SEASON 9 EVER . SO MUCH DISAPOINTMENT .I WAS WAITING FOR IT BUT AS SOON I UPDATED TO SEASON 9 ,LIKE BOOM MY INTEREST IS GONE FOR IT .STUPID UPDATE EVER .Full of glitches , no one is fixing these kinds of bugs , will always stuck when an enemy approaches , when they kill you then the game stops freezing . Always hv server issues , connecting issues , waiting issues . Full of bugs . Dont know why they are not fixing it despite dozens of complaints , also stop looting people with cash",1
"Good Game exept health kits only one thing bad about this game is health while playing ..the health kits given from starting was good but the health kits giving now is bad..we can't play in blue zone...plsss fix it give old kits for health.. Loved it , I am playing this game since tha first day of its release. It is my daily habit.stress releaver, Good grafics,god mods, and everything is good,",5
"I've been playing this game for years, every update, the game gets worse, my movement pad and shoot button, works when it wants to or when it feels like it.",1
"Please put a switch to change the shot automatically and manually on the game screen controls, switching through the settings section will make the gameplay very slow. üòä‚ò∫Ô∏èüòò",5
"Sn30 pro doesn't work on cod mobile. Wth man this is some bull can you guys support controllers that have a damn Xbox logo on it I bought that controller one because it's small this very mobile, the console Xbox controller is too big so I'll need to carry that all day and it's not exactly pocketable. 2 it supports Xcloud gaming so it's like having a mobile Xbox one your phone, Minecraft works with this asphalt works with this controller but the shooter everyone plays doesn't. Lame ash üíÄ",2
"Changed my ratings from 1 to 5, I love playing this game. I came to know that the issue of the black screen was not because of the game. It was because of the operating system and the issue has been resolved in the latest security update. Sorry that earlier I blamed the game.",5
"Couldn't even play the game even once coz it always keeps looping in the ""Getting Version Info"" loading screen... It goes upto 99% and then loops again... Device model:- Realme 5i 4GB RAM, Snapdragon 665 CPU",1
Love this game..but ever since new upgrade game starting to freeze. Weapons despair n so does the shooting button. Game goes on but u cant move or shoot.... plz fix bugs asap.....just redownloaded it... hope it works.....PLZ FIX BUGS...,4
"Loads of good stuff . Liked a lot. Best graphics for multiplayer matches. Exciting new events., skins, weapons, ... Many new modes like always there will always be 3-4 new modes every time and 8 basic modes and ranked gives u a lot advancement in game play, like challenging. Best game ever I TACK BAAAAACK WHAT I SAID!! I changed from 5 -> 1 becoz it's hardly abled for an avg player with that absurd game size and specs needed to play game... It's not very handy, no wonder its not popularin india",1
"This game is becoming toxic due to various items like 1 hit kill melee wepons and thermite, molotov etc.. melee wepon and thermite are the most toxic and annoying stressfull items in the game. Please please please remove this toxic items from ranked mode üò°üôè. And fix lag issue in BR. Make a balanced and optimized game. Don't add unnecessary modes events or free trash items in the game. It makes the game more bigger in size. Listen to the community codm.",4
Keeps backing out to my home screen during match and downloading.... Then it will be nice if y'all can make this app run in background... Right now PUBG winning... Y'all updates sucks . It's like it's being rushed... Ware zone make the load out to where we can swap guns after death,3
"I love the game and events but just a suggestion for the crates etc can we not get duplicates? Seems like a waste of money and time to just keep getting common/uncommon things over and over after grinding for a crate, then the event crates like the legendary or mythic draws the price goes up like 30,80,140 etc just seems like a lot",4
I have played this game in both mobile version and computer version this game never disappointed me Great graphics and smooth frame rate experience and its MP mode so much to say its so smooth I am very happy with it.,5
"This is the best game played in mobile in my life, though I played most of the Call of Duty games. It has some problems that makes me to reinstall. But, without this, everything is perfect.",5
"It's safe to say this game, hands down, holds the spot of #1 Android Shooter. There is no contest. Talking to you PubG Fans. I've found only to argue are the immature 12 y/os who arent good enough to play Cod, so they cry about how Pub-G is a better game with its Cartoony sh* Animations. Opposing the ranked & quick match multiplayer maps that are pre much equivalent to console vers, Battleroyale matches now on 3 maps, plus ongoing improvements done on zombies, That Is TheCall Of Duty Mobile!",5
"Love it (sike), you wanna burn sometime play this game. One problem tho yall should bring back zombies, id really appreciate it. Update:‚Üì Yea that review up there^ was when I could actually play and I gave it 4stars but guess I can't play now because God knows how my account was deleted and I've been playing from the game first came on play store sad but COD y'all trash for this. Took away zombies then delete my account guh suck uno muma. Update:‚Üìgot back my account but major lagging in BR. 22üí©",1
So addictive. Just like the original console online parts. I wish they added a campaign ie premium dlc too. also I'm annoyed that it's 30% cheaper to buy smaller packs than the biggest which advertises itself as having the biggest % free but in reality it's just over twice as much for 3x the cost. so it's misleading. why would I pay ¬£99 for 10800 when it's ¬£35 for 5000?,4
"Stupid tutorial you can't exit, then more stupid game designers forcing you to change load outs and you can't push any buttons to just skip so you can play. I immediately uninstalled without even playing, tell the devs players want control.",1
After updating into the latest version when I launch the game it always says that download configuration failed. I have used mobile network and also wifi but no changes. My internet connection is good. Pls fix this issue.,1
Your simple aim mode needs work I can't fire at an enemy near a vehicle It won't lock on when the sight is directly on his head I won't lock on at enemy's until I'm half dead ND if I could fire a cupel milliseconds before when I'm leading a moving target that be great overall its not bad targeting system needs some work cant hit drivers ether u can shoot thru smoke cause of the lock on system if u happen to find the target tho when your cq it won't lock on sometimes needs work rockets ate lit.,3
Earlier it was good. But now it's lagging so much. When enemy is near its controls either stops working or misbehaving. Worst experience. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª I've stable connection and good Internet speed.,1
Can't login. Just says authorization error. If you have a samsung don't bother. Constantly crashes. Update: Got a One Plus phone. Works great now!,5
For a phone game this is incredible. If you enjoy Call of Duty on other platforms you will sure enjoy this. Great to pass time without having to load up a console or sit at a computer desk.,5
Should put all the zombie modes from all previous Call of Duty games now that would be amazing.Just have a high end device! Average Wi-Fi Or Mobile data you should have a awesome time lol. Look for Refresh rate 120 is really good 90 is ok.. Best game on mobile hands down. Great work Activation,5
When I downloaded the game it's keep saying unstable network fix's the bugs and I will going change my score.And now it's impossible to play because it's keep freezing and it's impossible to win.,1
The game crashes when I open it. I don't know why it's happening I tried clearing my memory and cashe and the problem still continues. My device has no issues I used to play games like pubg and genshin impact in this phone so i think the problem is with the game please fix this issue.,1
"Absolutely amazing game! The last update was a little glitchy and slow at times, but overall, this game provides an excellent experience. I'm looking forward to this season 4 update!",5
"I've noticed this problem with the game in my handset, the application is not opening without Wi-Fi connection. I've tried using mobile data a lot. It's happening since last 3 seasons. I don't know it could be a problem with my phone. Is there anyone else who's facing same kind of issue ?? How could I fix this problem ?? ** I've reinstalled the game twice** Any kind of information on this regard will be helpful Thank you",4
It's always cracking. This season 4 update is full of trash. Initially I thought it was my phone network but it's not it's from my network but from the new update. Please give us our COD back or better still roll back to the previous version.,2
Great gameplay for a phone app shooter game. CP coins are an absolute rip off tho. Plus I've not received CP several times after purchasing. Don't spend money on it and the game is great otherwise,4
"Zombies needs to be a permanent part, its the best part of the game. Will increase to 5 stars if it becomes permanent, but without it the game is rubbish",5
I have nothing but glitches and I get kicked out of the games. Tired of having network issues when myself has perfect signal via data or wi-fi. I miss zombies.,1
"The game is exceptional but it's still poorly optimized and lags like hell, this lagging got worse like a few seasons ago, and it just keeps getting worse, please do something about it.",4
"Response times are already not so great. But when factor in that you can only get good skins if you pay 100+ dollars? And I happened to notice after watching other YouTubers(US) drawing experience, that they are paying a lot cheaper? Not for me. Uninstalled.",1
"Amazing game, it has been fun to play through my few years of playing it. Although I have started to play other games, this remains one of my favorites. The amount of weapons, events, and other stuff is simply astounding.",5
I love this game I have been playing it for 2 years and it was normal for those years but when season 3 came out I updated the game as fast as possible the game looked so much better I played my first game and it was horrible when ever I try to run it just will kick me out of the game and I was confused but I thought it was a glitch i went to my next game and same things happen even when I walk or I go prone hate this so can you please fix this that's why it is 1 star and it is not my phone,1
"If this game continue the way it's going, it's gonna be unplayable just because of its size. Slow it down devs, you don't need to add multiple weapons and maps in each season. What about only one gun each season and one mp map every 2 months?",5
"My game crashes every time I try to download any of the maps or skins, I have a Motorola one 5G UW. it hasn't always done this, earlier seasons of the game, but now it does.",1
I really love how smooth the gameplay is without framedrops. They sustain connection even in low net speed. The deathmatch and frontline are great experience.,5
"Overall experience is good. Realistic Graphics, smooth game even on Mid-range phones & on Android too. Probably the most realistic mobile game graphics, HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE MAJOR PROBLEM WHICH IS THR GAME IS TOO BIG, IT IS 5GIGABYTES IN SIZE.",4
"At First I loved this game too much that I was addicted to it I even played it on Mobile and PC Emulator but I quit because I was getting bored of all the maps, guns and all the Modes which were only limited but after 6 months I have returned to this game after updates I will rate it 3 because the game is a little boring",3
"I keep experiencing these highly disgusting login timeout error issues,it clearly has nothing to do with my fast internet. CODM developers,pls do something to fix this. It's super frustrating thanks.",1
"The game is trash now things keep ruining it, like persistence, the freaking K9-units, and overpowered meta weapons every season. The game had a very good start but now the developers stopped giving a damn about there game, and don't even get me started on the lag for lower device players.",2
"Instead of adding newer guns' blueprints every season try making the gameplay better especially in BR (lag spikes, frame freezes and network issues are just everytime thing now in br).",1
The game is fantastic and the controls are user friendly. I have nothing to complain in this game at all. It's an excellent console graphics experience on mobile,5
"I can't stop playing this game. The best game ever. üí™ Honestly am getting disappointed for the past few weeks after the update, my game keeps crashing, pls Activision needs to fix a lot of bugs and glitches in this game, its so frustrating and annoying üò§. COD is becoming trash now. The update is not cool at all, i still love my old COD. The bugs are too much. Game hangs while playing, this game is just so annoying most of the time, is not making me happy anymore üò¢",4
i can't play the game because of timeout and it says download configuration is failed and connect device with network even tho it's connected to good wifi please fix it as fast as possible I have ever cleared the cache and reinstall the game many times but it doesn't work My device is poco X2 pro,1
"World's best Game now available in Mobile. Thank u but only one feedback that due to Game server issues, the game room gets cancelled and XP is deducted and banned temporarily. I faced it once but it was not my fault. Pls look into it.",4
Must you always download additional resources every week.once I take a 4 day break and come back suddenly I need to start downloading additional stuff just to play.Then the new ground war is just terrible.I keep getting shot at without seeing who shot me.when did that one start.,3
"Awesome! game üòäüòäüò°Untill, when anyone can report you randomly. Then you get ban cause of some random etc. But, if ""Activision Support"" or ""Timi Studio"" could fix that much for me. That be nice. Anyhow the game ""was"" ok. Untill some like that occurs. Thou i worked hard to that lvl 72 tier 101 and paid real money alot, finding it to being deceiving. Game complete trash. Delete guest account although I'm using the same phone. There option of data save is garbage, trash.",2
An extremely balanced Fps/Tps game which gives u a wide variation of guns and weapons to use ranging from Missile Launchers to katanas. The Game Could improve on basically just the gameplay and maybe a new battle royale map but all in all if u like shooter games u cant go wrong with Call Of Duty.,4
"I was playing this game for over a week now and today while I tried to login, i could see that the game got automatically reset for some reason and asking me to login which I was doing till date. I was at lvl 24 and its asking me to start all over again. Very disappointed.",1
This is the best game I've ever played if you read this rate you have to get this game I love everything about the game but sometimes my phone system ui doesn't respond so it kinda hard to play but otherwise it's great you get to play with all your friends who have the game speak to them online play with teams there even zombies üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in this game it just wonderful I love I. It's the best mobile game in existence so far. Pub g and all those other stupid games is nothing compared to cod.,5
"I think it's time to talk about my experience about this game well its nice and fun,enjoyable but the problem is this the game size now I want to update the game but its taking years to be updated and you call it mobile game ü§£ am not here to mock but spit the truth out reduce the storage u are using o our phone jezz, you keep taking all the storage on the phone but the phone storage always remain the same common brain. Pls don't do this just to be in your convince zone always think of others.",3
"I absolutely love this game. The graphics are insane and for a person whose never been good at shooting games,I must say that this game allows you to learn. Never would have thought I'd be good at a shooting game but yeah I'm a beast.",5
"Call of Duty is a great game ,there is none other game like this. But pls update TDM fpp and tpp mode . Make this game useful, by adding fpp and tpp mode in TDM. And if went out of the zone in battle royal game there is no any bandage feature available, pls add that healing features so we can increase character hp out side the zone .",5
This game has been the best game I have ever played in my live. And I would really like if COD mobile would please bring the Darth Vader character from starwars into the game for fun gaming. And I would like to get the caracter first to test it out and review it. If you are wondering to install the game don't waste your data on other games and download Cod Mobile Please!,5
"Beautiful game! It's not pay to win AT ALL!! Awesome guns, great music, sound effects, everything! Make sure you play with good headphones and lots of bass, it gets my adrenaline pumping baby!!",5
This game is awesome. Works pretty good without crashes. I don't pay for anything and have a blast. I just wish there wasn't so many pop ups for promos but it's a minor problem.,5
Only started when it first came out so what would i know.. takes way too long to get a ranked mp match. Might as well give bots so people don't give up and leave. Zombies should die from headshots. I'm sure there are a few hackers and seems pointless to report.,1
"Hi cod publishers or activision . I love your game . It's got good graphics and is really fun to play. I am facing a problem since you updated the season . When I log in , it's taking a while and showing loading player info. It comes till 99% and stops suddenly. Then after few mins it says that you don't have a proper net connection. I coudn't play cod for 2 days dude I mean my net is really powerful. Pls clarify this issue. Other wise this game is as good as gold....",4
They need to cut space whenever they provide an update. It just keeps getting bigger and making it harder for regular people with regular devices to play the game.,1
Game issue needs resolved. It's not allowing me to log in. Wasn't having any issues till 2 days ago when it stopped letting me log in. I use my Google account. Have u installed and reinstalled 3 times and it still just stays at the log in screen.,3
Fyi dont be in a hurry to level up....once you get to 150 it seems like everyone is a quick scope shooter on the snipers and you get put in a match that has already started with no chance of you having a chance against the opponent......also dont buy the skins....after a month of the tiers and rifle skins they will be given to ya....also dont play to much ranked match...level up on the MP matches first.....oh and dont download undead siege...its a waste of time.....anyway this review is heads up,1
"Since this morning 12/05/22 after getting 55mb update the game is saying ""low disk storage"" while 46gb storage is free. I hv no sdcard. I did everything from clearing cache to restarting the device. Im not able to access the game. Plz fix. Device is high end device.",1
"If the game was more like warzone, like for e.g if redeploy was a parachute instead of the wingsuit same with jumping from the plane. And when you die the way you crawl should be different and the game sounds the graphics and render distance, and all the guns. And the maps and the while concept of money and buying yo teamates back and all that, also if we could have stims to give us adrenaline would be great. This would highly improve the gameplay in my opinion",5
"Tried updating my app, but it won't work After wasting my time and data to upgrade Keeps saying ""Can't download from playstore. Like am frustrated rn Pls do something. Yeah this was me before but game is on point now but can never be perfect so still 4 stars. Me again, pls the size of this game is getting too much, I want to know why",2
"One of my favorite games ever I played. But it is consuming more space day by day. Maps, camos, guns, skins, characters, etc have to be downloaded again after every update. Every time after the update, new maps are given, which are also correct but now the game is filled with maps. This game consume almost 10GB of my storage although I have not download all the maps, skins, camos, etc. They should reduce some of these or additional data size; otherwise it will be as like as PC version üòÖ",4
"Not only are the in-game purchases wildly over priced, they also falsely advertise. Claims of ""no duplicate items"" are made. Even with screen recorder evidence customer service refuses to make it right. Definitely won't be given them another cent.",1
Good game just weapon skins cost a fortune. I wanted the new mac10 legendary skin and it took me until last drop to get it. Cost me 130 euros. NOT COOL! I really like the game but the cost is astronomical.,4
I had a good review at one point and it was all good until I spent money. Somehow that puts me in a bracket of players I can't even play against. I just don't understand this match making system. I went from I'm so so at this to I can't fight against anyone anymore. pay to quit I guess.,3
"Great game, especially for mobile devices but it crashes way too many times not to mention and takes so long to load back in that rejoining a match is useless.",4
Interesting when I don't add money to your game all of a sudden I don't win any games/matches don't matter if I have a fast connection on mobal data or wifi. Seem to get multiple occasions where a player is afk or leaves the match on my team. Is it just me?,1
The app has bug it doesn't start and always gives download error of configuration when you start the game. This started after tropical updates,1
"Still the undisputed, reigning champ of the mobile FPS genre. While other games compete for the battle royale sector, CODM is first and foremost a mp game. And nobody does it better.",5
"It doesn't open at all always showing no connection while connection is stable, I had a account that got deleted with no reason it doesn't load at all, I even gave a feedback but never got any reply.",1
"Can you guys fix the app! I updated the new software and I have an account butI can't even get on the lobby. However, I played it once by using a guest but it won't let me go back. I would give this a 5 star if you can fixt it asap",3
This game is just amazing but the only problem is whenever I close this app and open it next day I have to log in again which is kind of annoying and yeah when I don't play it for 2 days I need to uninstall and reinstall it again just login like srsly?!,4
The game before the update was great. But since I had to update to the 5th addition every time I go to login the game freezes. I can't even get into the game.,1
It doesn't move after 70 in the loading section I don't know why. I was so hyped up about the tlgame downloading and now it downloaded but now that everything is done the loading part inside the game isn't working. Fix it and tell me what was wrong,4
Got a random ban contact CoD support and they just confirm there is a ban but don't do anything to explain why. I have contacted them three times and third time they just closed my case without even discussing anything. I read the terms and conditons and cannot find anything I have conflicted with to cause a ban! Very rude customer support service. I have spent a lot of money on my account and this is how you get treated shocking.,1
Good graffics and great timer killer after the new downloads the game glitches way more please fix this. I already freed up space and uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still glitchy.,2
New update and the game isn't working. Once the Facebook sign in option comes the screen freezes with music playing. please fix this!,1
"This game gets worse with each update. Even with Shader Preload active, the game lags after 1 BR match. I know it's not my device because I have a lot of available RAM. I refuse to spend any more money on this game",2
"This is the best game with exceptional graphics. Frequent updates, maps and character are awesome. Love this game. Now playing for over 4 years now üòÅ",5
So...recently there's a bug in a game. When ever i try to open the game with my own mobile data it doesn't starts. I always need to start it with another's wifi pls work on it I hope the team will work on it!,4
Amazing game for a mobile version... My biggest gripe is with the bots. It would be nice if you could disable bots in regular MP games.. I would be willing to wait a little bit longer for a game with less bots,5
Sincs the recent updates it takes up all the room on your device every season needs more and more space now it's telling me that to delete everything off my tablet just to play this game and I mean everything I don't know what they're putting in this game but it's not worth it there's something fishy about this why a game is so big is stupid the game was fine as it was,1
"Amazing game.. Looks like PS or Xbox codm War zone, great gaming.. Just it sucks we cannot much really compete in later tournament stages. And our Ping is bad due to lack of Servers in SA. Would be nice if we could get some installed",5
"After the latest update game is showing connect to a good network and re-start game , however my connection is very good . It had made worst experience as I can't play the game when I get time .",3
The game is really good the graphics and all but it takes a lot of time to load its like I'm waiting from around 13 minutes straight and the game is still loading even tho my data speed is around 800 kb per second....,1
Worst update ever.... I don't what happened after update...but they change a lot of things in BR which are responsible for this worst update...first the knocked enemy needs more damage to be killed...worst thing to ever do...and I don't know what happened to Fennec and Mac10...if they are nerfed then it's okay...but if not then why they are taking so many shots to kill...I mean pls bring back those things and let it be...we don't want these things to get worsen as more updates come in the future,2
Best game ever audio and graphics are amazing just one thing thou pressing ok everytime you recieve something is time consuming just mail it and then check after playing a few games.,5
Didn't think it would hold up to player unknown Battleground. I would say it far surpasses pubg. Gameplay is excellent fun and challenging. The game has come a long way since the beginning,5
"Was a fun game till the whole app just stopped working properly. Had to reinstall and then it wouldn't download the resources properly yet I could run a game fine but i could only download the resources when I used a vpn it worked fine, am I ip blocked or something? But it legs me play games on my network with out a vpn.",2
Its a good game amazing its just well. There are allwase these updates about futuristic weapons i done like it I hate wen the are these futuristic weapons can't there just be modern weapons? But other then those stupid futuristic weapons its a pretty good game. I KEEP LOSING MY PROGRESS AND MY STUPID ACOUND TOKEN WONT WORK,1
"Love this game. I don't like the new rating system though. It takes the competitive nature of the game away. I also don't like the ""like"" buttons. This isn't a social media app. I wish they would remove it.",4
"I really love the game, but after the update when I try to open it, it says""timeout"" and send me back to the login page. Please could u look at this, it's really fustrating.",5
Too many heavy updates. It's like starting from scratch. Kindly consider economical updates where we only upgrade from previous version not the whole game. üò°,5
"This is a fun game but there are some issues: *On battle royale enemy on opposing teams team up. *Many cheats are used durng gameplay, despite reporting every time it happens, they do not seem to correct it or punish the cheaters.",2
Amazing game still has a few bugs and glitches like the sunken ship karambit camo not working and not showing up when equip to the base melee that's the only reason for 3 stars from me if it wasn't for that camo glitch it'd be 4 stars and the luck of getting a legendary or mythic weapon is way to low if it was higher that'd bump it to a 5 star review overall good game fun enjoyable with friends also very stressful,3
"The game is just awesome especially graphics and detailing is soo preciseü§©ü§© best mobile game. Just make matches like Drop Zone, Gun Game and Attack of the undead permeant. They are the best ones ü§©",4
So many bots it seems their movement algorithm is way too obvious. I like the smoothness and overall game but moving around zombies too keep your profit intact is annoying plus the bots.,2
I'm facing problem from last 3 days... Whenever I open the game it's stuck on log in page.. It loads for few seconds then it show time out.. I have reinstalled the app but facing the same problem again & again & again... Pls solve this issue as soon as possible,1
And back down my rating goes because they took zombies away from me twice like they took there original zombies away for months maybe almost a year and brought it back in a small way with undead seige or it was called something like that but they only had those zombies not even for 2 months and another update comes along and bam no more zombies...im kinda upset about it like the second zombies did suck and with that being said they shouldve left the first zombies the way it was cuzz it was fine,2
"It's a blast from the past... In a good and bad way. GOOD: Interface, selection of weapons and streak bonuses. Familiar old maps like Rust, Dome and Nuketown. BAD: Same old cheats aimbotting and wall hacking... Yawn.",3
Really fun gamemodes plus battle rolay is really fun but one problem is how my teammates tried killing me with a grenade and blowing up my car for no reason. But the gameplay is really good and fun to play!,5
This game is so glitchy it will not recognize a wireless controller until you reconnect and restart the app 4 times. Whoever programmed this deserves to be fired.,1
"It has been nearly three years, An RPG game getting realeased while a game like PUGB was like god of mobile game, Even though COD is an most popular PC & Console game, Only few knows about COD compared to PUBG. At that time I was a ACE level player in PUBG and wanted just to try CODM and I tried, I was impressed with graphics in MP matches but not in BR. PUBG faded away as CODM became my primary because of those HACKER in PUBG. It felt more likely and the game play was improved. In CODM not only",5
Heats up device easily even though i have been playing on Medium Graphics... Few lags and frame drops here and there.. sometimes makes the game unplayable.. Desync issue also sucks,2
"Game will not load past the login screen, everything loads up fine until you get to the login part and then it freezes. Please fix this.",1
Please give the solution auto update this game. I'm long time player but now is big problem auto update game. I can't stop. I'm trying long time. But not working wel. I hope you will give the solution. Thank you I'm your best coustermer.,1
"So far the game was great but this updates makes the game laggs, when opening the game and says loading it disappear but gets freeze for about 2 minutes before signing in to the accounts required.",2
Keeps crashing can't even get to the start up screen just shows black. Please fix this ASAP then will give better review.,1
"With every freaking update they make the game worse FPS is low even though I'm using Samsung s21 Internet problems even though last update it was completely fine I have played this game for more than 2 years and wasted lots of money in it So if you are thinking about playing it, i don't recommend it",2
I am playing this game since last 6 months. Now I am getting time out error. I have tried reinstalling the game. But still getting time out error.,1
"What happened to the bundles? I hate yall are forcing us to buy crates and lucky draws typical cash grab, the cod coin store has nothing in trash skins, guns are still pay to win, and this last update was awful skins have no details to them nothing unique about them, and not to mention 1 of the worst battlepasses of all time...fix all the lagging and glitches in the game fam and stop knocking us over the head with these prices for mediocre gameplay...gave us 4 trash female skins üòí do better",2
"Really quite good for mobile. Only complaint is the lack of play to win female characters vs male characters. After months of playing consistently I have like 3 Charly, an ugly Alice and 12 random men. Boo.",3
"You need to show every player's latency in stats, I'm so mad of this UNFAIR situation, dying because of desync. At least, I want to play with same latency players in my custom rooms. Some players going to abuse their ping advantage and what did you do against them? I'm playing this game for a long time, but if no one cares, I'm going to leave because of this unfair situation. It's really going to ruin my mental health, because I CAN'T do anything about it.",2
I'm changing my rating to 5 star as to make vary the tencent that please make it possible for COD to login with Facebook Lite as well l. I deleted almost of the apps to keep this game. The game gets logs out sometimes and each time I have to download the Facebook app and login.,2
"For a mobile game it's really good. if you have a slower phone I don't recommend as it will lag alot even if you have good internet. This goes to the devs, do you think you could add the m4a1 from modern warfare 2019 please?",5
"I know alot of people have been complaining about Activision not spending our battle pass monet on better servers etc etc to fix game lags etc etc, but did any of you stop to think their spending that money on making an awesome new game for us like Warzone mobile. Just think about it before you guys complain about a company that has given us so much awesomeness since that start.",5
"$50+ for skins and death kills is just dumb. Battle pass is it's saving grace. Overall, game is good and I enjoy my time with it.",3
"Ever time I log in to update it logs me out. Just after like a minute. Fix the problem, I've been playing since it came out and spent way to much money to play this game.",1
"Very slow server. My ping is always running between 100-105ms. It's really irritating, even the bots are killing me easily. Please improve your server.",1
"Was best mobile game to waste my time on, but after latest update it freezes after selecting login option. Will give it 5 stars right after i will get it running again.",2
Updates have been hit and miss but overall an excellent game... Especially when you take into account that it's free to download and play.,4
"Well been at it for a year now..... Still as exciting as the first time I played it.... Downloads are what's killing it, after updates hardly have data too play all month... Smaller updates fo shur... Other than that, still a fun game inwhich I injoy.",5
"The game is trashy now. They allows PC players to fight against mobile players. They're so stupid. I PF players can move faster, shoot extremely perfect shots, and have unlimited health.",1
It was an amazing game until last update ruined my experience üòê game atleast takes 2-3 mins to open after the recent update. Earlier on it was so quick. Idk whether iam the only one facing this issue or is it familiar to everyone? I use mi 11x SNP 870 chipset 8gb ram.,4
"First of all login issues, it takes so much time to login when compared to previous update and having major FPS drop in MP matches and BR matches..... Can't able to move faster and some times gyro doesn't work.... Please Fix this issue soon....",1
"Super fun, until you die to a dog then the fun stops and you start raging for no reason and cussing at your lamp for not being bright enough. Yeah actually there are many things that are annoying. Never play shipment and expect to have fun unless you are a piece of s***.",4
This game could be the best game on mobile but the amount bots ruins my experience. Bots should not be in ranked mode. Bots should not make half or most of any lobbies. I would give a one star review but at least I am able to win/earn things for free,2
"It's my favorite game of all, I like that if you didn't pay, anyway you have options to enjoin de game with sympathy figures. The quality it's very good from other, I really recommended, is addict.",5
"Love this game. I play it every single day, in my opinion it's one of the best if not the best FPS game currently, it might even be the best mobile game out right now. It's a wonderful game. I love playing CoD on my PS5 and Xbox, but when I heard that CoD was coming to mobile, I was so excited to play. I've always loved the CoD franchise, and I'm excited to see where the franchise will go in the future, and I'm extremely excited for the future of mobile gaming",5
constantly locked out of accounts creating new ones loosing the coolest rewards and payed for items...1 star because i have to start over all the time...my tokens are no good and tossed them im still on same google account. wheres my buy ins??? 6 months later still nothing...you guys are a bunch of richards....,1
"been playing since season 1 was looking forward for season 5 as i recently bought the s22 ultra and since the update i need to delete and reinstall the game each time i wana play the game & with 16gb of game storage you can imagine how long it will take for that, season 5 for me is a big L",2
"It's doesn't open,as soon as I downloaded the latest version of it. At first i wasted my 6 GB of internet and it couldn't download at the moment but after i downloaded it it doesn't open. What the hell is wrong with this game...Users any suggestions...plse let me know",4
"Why i have only medium graphics option ?? My phone has a gamming processor Helio G85 6gb ram , why i cant play on high settings there no option for it , i installed to play with friends cz i liked its graphics more than battle grounds , but it looks potato , fix this .",1
I've climbed into master rank from bronze in battle royal and almost every single match has been bots. I'd rather wait 10 minutes in matchmaking than play against all bots. Get rid of the a.i. entirely in your battle royal. Give us an organic experience.,3
"I used to love this game, I've played for many hours on my phone, the latest update (season 5) I can not play anymore. It crashes, going on a half hour and not able to play",1
I've had to make 2 different accounts because my first one stopped working and the token never work. So I made a new jne and the same damn thing happend fix it or help me. I'm uniatalling your game until you fix the problem,1
"So many problems in this update, too much time in loading screen most Annoying is HIGH ping and why there is increase in number of bots in multiplayer matches.",1
This is the best game for me but the lag really makes me go crazy at crucial times and it's really upsetting please do something about it and also the fact that you get killed but your team mates are alive but they tell you spectator left and kick you off the game and you find out you all ain't dead yet its just you dey kicked out don't know if it's nectwork or wah you just got to fix it,5
"the game is whack, it's asks you "", permission to download"" and still downloads everything anyway. Needs major fixes as that already is a lie. I dont want to download certain things and it downloads everything anyways....9‚ÜëG game ....",1
Fun game but I absolutely hate the new season(s) and updating. Beginning of every month and after waiting 5 mins I can't even get in to play. Someone look into this.,3
"Ok, so ive noticed everytime i log on it looses internet and wifi connection everywhere ive played with a strong wifi. I feel its done on purpose....ive done many tests with other games, but cod is always faulty everytime in the middle of a game",3
This tropical update has made the game so sluggish its almost impossible to play BR mode when there's a tense fight b/w different teams....upset really upset from cod mobile developers....the game has crossed 15 GB storage ....i am so close to delete this game,1
I hv been playing this game since Oct 2020...It was a lot better back then... Now all we get in Codm is lags and bugs... it's very irritating when the game laggs during MP ranked matches and Battle Royal.. They are making the game worse with every update..,2
COD op Other games tati. I love this game so much. I am fan of this game. But now I play it in galaxy j7 in this game is not smooth. Please luanch COD lite which will also be available to download it in Android 6.0.1 and will be smooth in weak smartphones.,5
It's pretty good game but the hardcore players needs to stop killing players that quick in Battle Royale. I was so mad so the hardcore players needs to stop please and play what it should be and have fun.,5
This game used to be good but I think am not the only one facing this like why would they remove the easy one tap use to deny You from logging into your account with Google I had reached a level now I have to go back to scratch what a pain in the butt this is not valid you COD guys can't keep doing this to people for real for real check on yourselves,1
Good graphics the game is only for people who want to spend money on a few simple perks !!!!! . They have made a really good game and are cashing in to the max .,3
"Epic gameplay but can't play on low end devices it really lags and does not work well always has to restart the game because it crashes in between , really bad graphics in low end devices like J7 A10s and S5 and about the new season it is completely ruining the fun of CoD please try to make it better üòÄ üòâ üëç",5
What's a nice way to say that signal connections are absolute garbage and are equivalent to Amber Heard's legal team? Because even those incompetent pea brains could probably make a better game. Online signal sucks.... Connected to wifi and stuck playing at a 100+ ping?! Seriously pull heads from asses Activision,1
THE BEST MOBILE GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN . THE most requested wish by codm community was to remove persistence perk but u have made it a blue perk now which I will give 4 star . Bring back the og zombie mode and I will rate 5 star. And again best game .,4
I have played for a little while now. I'm updating my review. I just played in the tournament they are offering to players this tournament is a shame they are putting you up against players that are ranked way higher then you and have spent hundreds of dollars to get the upgraded guns that is a joke I will not play in the tournaments and I'm definitely not spending a ton of money just to play a game there should be a ranking system so you don't get destroyed and make the game NO FUN AT ALL,1
"All good :) great game, and free players have the same chance as paid, especially starting with the introductions of the Gunsmith. I do hope they slow down the size increase rate some.",5
Is there a negative rating possible? It's been 1.5 months .. the game keeps refreshing/reloading whatever it is while playing it... What is it? And cod team doesn't really care about it do they? I dont the vod team cares it's time to delete this annoying game.,1
"Hate the beginning I'll WILL NEVER be reimbursed with the money I put in after losing my account which I still find stupid having guess account set up like that. Yall even do random ban bots or something poopy asf jus banned as soon as I log in on my pc to play n first match I left was something new now just shut about not using external devices, thx whatever this is twice now I've lost 2 accounts n money twice now I don't wanna haft to deal w customer support on a game like this. Uncomfortable",1
"I love this game so much! It,s fun playing with new people! And also fun playing with new and old friends! But can their be a mega weapon that shoots drones that seeks out enemies and kills them?",5
"After last update almost imposing to play anymore. Game hangs in any mode. Starts game in a random mode. Really frustrating. Hope they fix it soon. My current device is S22 Ultra, Snapdragon.",1
This will stay a 1 star review until the developer fixes melee weapon stats. The Katona has a shorter attack distance than the axe and knife yet is longer. Also a Katona should do more damage than many of the others. None of the melee stats make any sense.,1
"Every ""update"" with this game is sooo frustrating and is usually a downgrade. It's like every single update y'all are ""fixing"" things that were never broken. From the swimming and gliding nerfs to the removal of team mics. Like why does this game continue to downgrade with every update.",1
Its great untill you want something i mean you pour money into this game to get the thing that you want like the arsinal thingy its gives you a rondom thing and dont get the gun or skin that you wanted instead you get this sucky thing that has no use and it gets more exspensive and one day you will be pouring hundreds of dollars into it and you still wont get the gun/skin tha you want so go ahead download it i just hope you have enough money,3
I updated my Call of duty and just to find out that my linked account had been erased and I have to start all over from Level one.... There's nothing as annoying as this.... call of duty is just very annoying.,1
"After almost every update the game crashes alot,this needs fixing,I was in the middle of a ranked match it crashed not my fault but I was still banned,üò†",3
"There's a problem Came in my Game, it's Customized LoadoutDrop,Whenever I try to loot a Customized Weapon airdrop The Confirm Doesn't appears while Looting the drop I don't know,it's happening again and again I tried reinstalling the game In thought of that the glitch or bug whatever it is Will be fixed But It didn't Worked,I think i m the Player who's facing this problem I have been playing for 1 year now I just can't Leave it in Between progress Please do fix It I m feeling Cry,Do something.",5
"Game has become unplayable in the newest season, anytime I try to play a match or battle royal, I lag out of the game, and I loose my stuff I earned last season!!! Worst game Ever!!!",1
"Best mobile shooter game I've experienced yet and I believe it will stay that way for a very long time. One word for this app is ""impressive"". -10/10",5
"I don't understand my there is a voting system in multiplayer ranked mode for maps , because everyone votes accordingly to their comfortable map and not able to play the new maps which are available for the play.",5
"Lagging, too many moving designs, too many buttons in-game and controller support is an absolute joke. It's sad when companies that pull millions can't be bothered to have quality games under their belt anymore.",2
The gameplay is really awesome But the I think the K9 unit is way to OP since it can intakill the enemy player and that it also take way too many shots to eliminate the K9 unit,5
"After the last update, a lot of completionist camos were stripped from my account. I grinded for a long time to unlock the Damascus camos and after this update a lot of them were taken away. I basically lost all my progress.",1
"This game, is ready good for anyone that is really competitive and its challenging. ( the graphics are really good to) thats way I gave it a 5 stars.",5
"I was suggesting that once one completes a mission especially on battle royal should be celebrating in a style,like choppers coming landing and picking you up returning you bay to the camp.I think this will be more realistic making it wow.üíØüëç",4
Great game but extremely long loading time. This needs to be addressed and fixed and hence dropping rating from 5 to 3 stars.,3
"Hi, Unfortunately due to some issues I had uninstalled the game. I am playing on Guest Account. Now I uninstalled the game. And to recovery my account it is asking token number but I didn't have old token number. Still can I able to recovery my account or I have to start from starting?",4
Very addicting at times when you wanna blow off steam lol had no issues with the game and is constantly giving us more game modes. Overall a great game,5
"Why the hell is it downloading everything!?? I am disabling the option every time but the in game resources just don't stop!!! I don't play zombie, blackout and other maps then why the hell is it downloading everytime pls fix this problem!!",4
"This is the best game ever I played ,that's all. I can't say any more or any bad reviews , it the game that I needed and ofcourse also you Activision best developers ever . I can't stop playing. One thing #Activision is the bestüî•",5
This game is amazing.And the detailing is best part of this game .The animation on krambit knife is far better.but the problem is my phone is low end and a little bit of lag also the new free krambit shipwreck is bugged.,5
"The battle Royal sucks, I have fill squad on and I don't get any f**king teammates I mean I think I am good at the game but having too constantly 1 vs 4 sucks, I have tried the other BR game modes, and still no teammates.",2
"I'm so in love with this up but just unfortunately i don't have that time so i can always play, but if you love war games or br games this is the right game for you on the mobile, just have a good phone that's all, enjoy üôÉ",5
"This game is owsome but the challange is ,there are alot of errors,connection to server is the big problem i wish you make this game a little easier for us log in the game . Thankyou very much",5
This game is one of the best FPS games I've played on my phone and continued to enjoy it with nonstop fun. Even my wife who doesn't like mobile games loves this too! If I could rate this higher I would.,5
Honestly This Game Used To Be Soo Good But Now It Barley Runs Well And Has Become Bloated Most Of The In-game Mechanics Are OP And Playing Just Isn't Fun Anymore. They Should Focus On The Basics Like Getting A Better Anti-Cheat Nerfing some guns And Nerfing Most Of The Score Streaks Rather then adding new maps skins and games modes. They Should Focus On fixng What's already there and improving upon it by actually taking into account what the community actual says because It's getting annoying,3
This is a great game but the constant updates are too much having to keep periodically downloading the same maps because you change them slightly is infuriating. You pick up your phone for a quick game then you have to update joke would be good if not for this,5
"The new tournament mode has ruined the game because cheaters, modders and hackers alike have decided to take advantage and cheat mod or use hacks to win. I don't know why I'm playing this game any more. Honestly it was fun but then more updates less fun as I have noticed even more hackers, cheaters and modders in every single match that I play. So I hope this review helps people realise that just cause this game is cool and entertaining for everyone, there is always going to be a modded version",1
the game is awesome but what the hell? why do i need to download the maps everytime there's an update. like only 50-80mb update then you need to download the 900mb-3gb more or less maps again. seriously? damn,2
"Because of paid weapons The game is now pay to win, especially in the Battle royal,these paid weapons make a big difference, but the worst are the many bots, now bots that wear and carry equipment like real players therefore I tell you stop spending money on time.",1
"Honestly it's a pretty good game but there is a bug where the karambit that you could get in the events doesn't show, like you can't see the skin, it's just a regular base melee",5
No. 1 online adventures game. But unnecessary update of every month makes storage burden in mobile. Update show 830 mb and real use of net is 1.8 gb that is a big problem in every update. Thanku you call of duty to return to my old call of duty I'd,5
"This game is truly amazing. Top of the line realistic graphics & suchh an amazing & smooth gameplay, but it takes quite sucks internet (like mosquito sucks blood). At last ""Bhai maja aa gaya; Kasam se""",5
CODM hear me out this new season don't add a mythic we can't keep added them every season or they'll lose there value so as legendary skins even gun skins and operator skills in mp we can't have a new one each season please change on that if u want to survive and thrive I used to have five stars but its gone down to 4 and remove grand master it's slowing down things so please codm fix things for one of ur favourite clients,4
The game is great. But there is a issue I am facing . It's the buffed Bots in Public MP and ranked BR. Bots are interrupting when I am engaged with oppents and survive with low HP and then a bot appears no where and kills straight away with its auto aim. This happens at least twice in normal MP hardpoint. In BR: When I am engaged with squad a bot distracts and when I am tryna hide a bot appears and reveals my position. Bots are taking away my fun from this game making me quit playing this game.,1
at times the lag in this game is horrible. other people are moving faster than you. it just makes in unpleasant to Play. this happens weather on wifi or mobile data.,3
"Always booting me out, at leat 8 times though out the week. Not cool when your in a BR match and down to to 5 teams, then the game BOOTS you out. Yea, think it will be a minute before I spend any money. Thanks but No thanks. I think I'm going to check out Pubg mobil, with 500 million down loads, WoWüî• 500 mill..",1
I love this game but should make it where players are able to get (CP) coins off having to buy challenges with regular (C) points and after completing challenges within a certain amount of time upon buying u gain just a small amount of (CP) to make it fair for non payable players,5
Very cool game. I don't like that bots have to fill the team. And low levelled players are joined with high levelled players. Other than that it's cool. I always been a COD fan.,4
"Great game, and if you're ever a little bored of other gun games, this would be the best one, because.it has all types of things like you can go to Battle Royale and if much more",5
I love the game but my accounts has been hacked and I've tried everything to kick the person out of my account but it doesn't help it's a person from india I can tell by the language they changed my gamertag it's very frustrating I've contacted cod mobile but they never respond to my email,3
Ever since the season 5 update it won't let me play the game. It freezes at the login screen and nothing fixes it.,1
This game will cheat you even if you pay the game server will cheat you. I still will never pay for something that is free. If I had to pay I will never play any of these games. They won't add all your kills but it will add all deaths everytime you die and some players you can not kill because I do not have a premium membership or something. The players always use some kind of cheat codes. Nobody can play this game without cheating.,1
It is a awesome game but needed some fix cause not everyone can afford expensive controller... hope they support more controllers for players to have it easy,3
I use to love playing this game . And even tho there are frequently updates I didn't mind but I'm giving this game one star because I have spent alot of money on this game and I don't know what you'll did to this game but I can login to my account which I used Facebook to sign in to .... It's been this way for over 2 months now I hate this ...,1
"Season 5 you messed up! I have to download the maps, characters & weapons daily every time I launch the game... why? Cumbersome at best. Fix it",2
what's Happened? Trying to load the game since update and won't get past the loading screen. Hope it gets sorted as ill lose my battle pass!!,3
This is an awesome game 5 stars only 1 bad thing is people are connecting PS and Xbox controllers which is NOT fair on the rest of the players I class it as cheating ! but overall the game is a 10/10,5
The game is good and all but the draws are hard I really want a legendary gun sooo bad but I can't even get one and it just makes me sad/mad and I used lots of cp and I don't even get a gun I really want one but I cant so that is why I will rate it 4 stars.,4
"I can't play or download anything from a wifi connection, only play through mobile data but my wifi connection is good, I play rest of the games but this game show me the issue, I use to clear data, cache, reinstall but same issue I am facing... üòê",1
The game is Good And very good battle royale game and i play but there was a bug If we have a wifi and play with it and one we play with the mobile network so game was not open so we delete the game and download it again so Problem fix but my resources was not download so this big bug fix it call of duty,5
Hey activision if you could add thrle weapons from the ps2 game area 51 specifically the xm32 viper assault rifle with the reloading animation and maybe the super weapon Or the bb9 do that and I'll give better rating but I'm still pissed at the ranked matches and how there rigged and all the aimbot using a holes that also ruin the game its supposed to be fun not frustrating,2
"Lot's buggs in season 5 update....max time high ms like more than 100 then max time can't login to my game through any WiFi, reinstall it several times,even I reset my device...still sucks .... can't hear team mate sound neither I can talk...what the hell is wrong man...",1
"Why Your server is dying day by day, You have to fix this bug but you guyz just focus on new things, new season, new rewards bur not on the old glitches & bugs, & thats why majority of your community hates this game now, You guyz don't fix your bugs from past 3 to 4 seasons like pings issue, character voice issue, what you guys doing????? I'm rating you 1 star again & hope so all the community gives you 1 star just because of your stupid glitches.",3
Buff the shotguns because they are trash for the most part and change the 15 long range kills challenge into a different easier challenge because the 15 long range kills is impossible,1
"Just like the others, just a little edge. Stand out, make an overhaul on clan mode. Clans should be like rebel factions planning on to overthrow which ever is ruling, all fighting on an open world battle field, guerrilla mode. More real life. With all the ability you have, I find it puzzling that you chose to rely on a boring mode.",2
Still having issues with bad lagging and screen freezes up all the characters look the same and Darren br unable to see characters from distance through sniper rifle,4
This game is better then every game. This game makes me relax and happy and also out of frustration. I really love this game and I am enjoying playing with my frnds but the biggest thing is u dont need Any custom card or room card you can 1v1 or play any mode with your frnds in 1v1 or 2v2 and many more you can challenge your frnds to fight with you and this all for free no money for 1v1 or 2v2. This is the best game in the world and I really really love this game and I will never bebored playing,5
The has pretty much ironed out most of the glitches. The problem now the game is it has become stagnant and BORING!!,1
I get penalties for the glitches in this game. I have to sign in every five minutes. The glotches are ridiculous. I'm stuck coming out of the same room over and over again.,1
"Amazing game, this is undoubtedly the best mobile game I've ever played. If you can't find CODM on my phone, then you'll most likely see no other game just yet. I love it üí™üî•",5
Game no longer loads passed the season 5 loading screen. Will sit there for about a minute then go black and force closes itself back to home screen.,2
Overall well done. To get all options you have to pay to play. If I could just buy the game for $50 and get all content like we used to I'd be happier.,4
Can't link accounts. Just paid for battle pass plus. And now everything is gone. Support is a joke. But they'll take your money quick enough. Just can't use what you purchase,1
Best game ever. What's with the sound bug this season though? Everything becomes dead silent all of a sudden mid game. What's with the ping spikes this season? It's horrific.,5
I love the game but I hate that it doesn't recognize usb c controllers. Like come on you already have Bluetooth support it can't be that difficult to add drivers for usb c.,5
I love playing the game I tried reinstalling the game to try and fix a bug but every time I download a pack on there the game crashed please fix the bug,3
"Best game, the multiplayer is soo amazing, br is also good it lag sometimes in my 2gb ram but it's a nice game. One problem is of update are soo big.",5
The graphics are perfect. The loudout is amazing. The characters are awesome. THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"There's No Adds Unless A Rreward thingy but it's stupid You can unlock weapons, weapons camos even unlocking new and awesome skins. This is the best game ever with different game modes like 1v1 deul Gun Game Over all this game is a five star (‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ)",5
This is a great game I am an old player Recently I have issues in loging its loadind and said timed out... You should fix this problem as soon as possible. Another problem is I can't log in with my cod account..... Why...?,1
"Game is fantastic with great graphics.. Fast paced game with such a engaging maps!! But please reduce its size, Make it under 5gb",5
This game is amazing ü§©ü§©.The only thing wrong with it is that I play on a tablet Android it is a slow and freaking laggy .But my friends have iPhones and the app works great üëç.I highly recommend this game.,3
"Absolute shite, the worst game play ever, no different to the rubbish on xbox or ps...full of cheats or just stupid money thrown in that makes it unplayable. Scratching my arse would be better time spent!",1
Too much space needed upgrade to next level slows my ram worst app i ever used . I have been using for two years but still not solving the issues.,1
"It plays just like if you were on a console, once you get used to the controls you can dominate your opponents.",5
Can't load app following recent update from developer and Samsung. Says failed Internet connection. Even with VPN I can't load past sign in page.,1
Still on season 4 thought it was going to update the season 5 like everybody else's but my but mine only installed the new season for last season which was season 4. Please fix. I'm playing on my tablet my tablet is an android as well. Please give me the option to add another update to it to get the new season 5 since I'm behind but ios got it no issue. But it never said that in the imprint that I saw on new updates ü§î,3
This game was great at the start but once you get into higher ranks people have paid for weapons that are a million times better than the guns your given with the game so it's pay to win so I have uninstalled,1
After new update graphics went to low and I can't change it going to delete if not fixed. I spent a lot of money on this game hate that this happened. I got a better phone works fine.,5
"The game is good but the items which we have already downloaded it give us one more time to download it in every update like characters,gun's camo,mp rank match map. Download mb is 2.12 GB .",4
I liked this game when it was in season one but What I don't like is the amor and The big boss (The big zombie) I liked the vests and it was more realatic in graphics and plz remove anything about zombies I don't like the tank too but the helicopter is good plz restore the good graphics and plz remove the stupid grenade which make blasts in all the players restore all the things in season one plz I don't hate the game but I want it to be better wish if you read the rating plz,3
"I love this game but the ""download configuration failed"" error has ruined it for me. The developers aren't replying back, no help whatsoever.",2
"IDK the game or the phone. It was fine until recently. I was a legendary player and I'm all of a sudden unable to play at all. With Realme 3 pro, after recent update....",1
Unplayable now to many lags can't get 1 shot without being killed when average get 30 kills lags all time by minimum 5 seconds behind other players also to many hackers in game using blatant cheats and nothing is being done about it you can't even enjoy the game anymore get top mythical weapons and can't use them as getting killed constantly by hackers with a rubbish gun using cheats all the time was 5 stars wouldn't give 1 now would rate zero better off with pugb and apex,1
"Bad game, there are many errors and the game did not work after the update. I am a fan of Call of Duty games. This makes me very sad from Activision üôÅ",1
Don't really know why I can't login to my Activision account anymore. When I do I get a notification incorrect password or email address. It's so annoying,3
You guys need to fix your servers..download the update and now it won't open..what a joke..now the game won't open and I lost all my progress on the new update...what a waste of time..,1
"The only challenge I get is the auto_login and CAPTCHA, because I need to enter my details most of the time, since it keeps failing.",4
Changing my one star to 5 cuz of the persistence nerf. Haven't even played the game yet with the changes but it sounds like a lot of scrubs are gonna have to git good. Thank you for finally seeing the damage caused.,5
"Just one problem for me, the bots. Real players are hard to identify now. Please make bots the same as before,will appreciate it a lot!",5
Needs razer kishi support that's the whole reason I got the controller just for this game please add the support. Other then that the game is pretty good and has fun content.,3
"After the new update I am unable to play the game for 1 week. It always shows timeout,timeout and timeout forever, I'm quiting this game.üò≠üò≠üò°üò°‚ò†‚ò†üëø please fix plzzzzzz im begging.",1
"It was working at first, all of a sudden it stop ever since it was been upgraded i have been trying issues with it logging in, please help fix this",1
At first the game was fun until I realized how much gb's it took up which really sucks becuz my phone then gets laggy and only have two other games on my phone I really wish it wasn't so heavy in taking up space but other than that pretty solid game.,3
"The best shooter ever, i played call of duty when i was 8, really love the gameplay, even with the overpowered guns, brings me nastolgia, great game, activission and timi, and good luck on developing warzone mobile!",4
rubish rrrrrubbbbbbbbish every time they bring a new update they just messss it upp more. takes ages to load and download keep saying conection problem hen there clearly isn't koz every thing else works perfect. overall dont waste your time with this unless they bloody fix it,1
"The Amazon sponsored rare operator packs rarely if ever successfully download. This is my 4th in a row that doesn't take my UID and code which can only be attempted once and support is garbage, no help.",3
"Takes extremely too much time to start the app. 9 minutes just to begin the game. I usted to love this game, but after this, I started hating it!!!",1
"The game has server problems as now I don't have a stable connection when playing the game. This wasn't happening in previous seasons, please fix this",1
the overpowered weapons and certain classes tend to ruin Br games. ingame ads for microtransactions EVERY TIME you log on on top of that. it is aggressive in its advertisements.,3
"I'm hoping this is just an unfixed error but new update only allows voice (mic & speaker) to go to two ""all"" options...",3
Does anyone feeling the lag between normal Oden with Mythic Oden? With sprint to fire delay and scope opening time? I'm facing this issue with Mythic Oden gun even I do have same attachments for normal and this and tried in same game. Is this a bug?,1
"This game is an absolute win for multishooter game lovers. Although as new updates comes, lagging increases. Asides that, I love the game. Item prices should also be considered. Reduce it a bit. Thanks",4
"I love this app, love the maps and it never gets old. Always been a fan of cal of duty and this game always have me coming back with new updates and new characters.",5
Can we please be able to update the game without having to download all the maps and other resources again (except the hd resources) and can you please bring back night mode and include Combat helicopters? Thanks,2
"Laggy gameplay, Screen stck randomly, High ping & download all the data again after a new update. won't recommend.Other FPS are much better :(",1
This is a great game don't get me wrong the game is awesome only thing that would help this game go further would be for them to stand up an an put a stop to the hackers cause they are gettingore an more everyday it's not fair to us an you can't say it's not when I watch a player teleport from being killed or me put 30 rounds In him an he keep goin I have the same amount of armor an he kills me one shot that's a hacker an when this happens is when all of us that is not hacking our game lags,5
I like how call of duty let's invite your friends to play the game with you if you losed that is fine just don't give up like the game easy and hard at the same time but just keep trying,5
The updates are too much guyyy......I just opened the app it updated itself (data that I don't even have) ok now it's done updating its not loading again. This doesn't inspire confidence at all,3
Game is awesome for me but when ever i try to connect my phone with wifi everytime it says DOWNLOAD CONFIGURATION FAILED PLEASE RESTART THE GAME. in short i can't connect my game on wifi please fix this otherwise this game in my opinion this game deserve 5 star until you guys solve my problem thankyou,1
Every time i go in it takes 5 minutes to load and when i finally go in the game its just says waiting fo 30 minutes and 70% of the time it just logs me out of my account and i have to go through all of that again and when it FINALLY loads i press play and THE SAME THIG HAPPEND YOU NEED NASA INTERNET TO PLAY THIS GAME ITS SO TRAAH,1
Took the entertaining categories out. Battle pass has nothing decent to offer. Leave it alone im sure you can see which sections are played the most.,1
Ok so overall the game is fantastic i just want to say that please add tactical sprint like mordern warfare because there are some people who doesn't have pc so they can't play pc games so just my recommendation.overall the best mobile game.,4
After new update game keeps dropping connection in the middle of almost every match. This game is useless and wasting of time.,1
Action Packed. Fun & Easy To Learn. User Friendly. Queing Time Is Quick. Battle Royale Is Loads Of Fun! Multi player is awesome and many more modes be sure to Check ‚úîÔ∏è it out you won't regret it.,5
Edit - please stop putting me in cheater lobbies. I stream this game and people can see that you guys are doing just that. I'm not a cheater. Nor have I ever even attempted to cheat. The first of every season goes well but after a while of doing really good I end up getting killed with one bullet and everyone knows where I'm at and all I get is bots on my team. The other team gets real people. I am a customer and I buy your stuff. Now I don't and I probably never will.,1
Ever since season 4 I have been having issues with my log in once I don't see auto login it just stops on d login page and the only way to fix it is to redownload it,1
New update sucks. Real players are impossible to pick now as bots don't use default skins anymore. It's unfair cause we spend hours playing and paying for those skins yet bots now have them. It's ridiculous so please put them back to normal and you'll get more stars.,1
"Huge updates after updates. Updates on playstore, updates in-game after you launch the game. Never-ending updates. In-app purchases too are a scam, it's a gambling system to win.",1
"Twice now I had to restart with a new account because Idk how to log in when the Google way isn't prompted. Annoying, just a sign to uninstall and try something new I guess.",3
I installed zombies from setting then install and download the zombies map no way to play it I'll give 5 stars when I can use the zombies map I downloaded my internet is slow took forever to download I downloaded it for nothing thanks alot that wasted my time,1
Hey I've been a cod multiplayer for years and I love the mobile version only problem I have with the game is after each update I have to download ranked maps all over again could that be something to look into please üôè,4
Idk what's wrong with it but it won't let me log into my Facebook account it just says we can't log you in or it says I don't meet a criteria but I was plating on it for a couple days and it wasn't doing that plz fix this,1
"Great job on latest update overall struggle with lagging resolved, new tournament mode doubleüëç, start adding level 4 gear in seasonal & featured events or even a legendary gun don't be shy we spending enough to be granted a freebie legendary or Mythic",5
Having to download all the time every new season is taking out too much storage. Other than that great game.,5
I love the game cuz it allows you to actually talk to people around the world and it's amazing..the graphics is fine and it's not that bloody...,5
"Great game but why the f do I need to download everything again every effing season? All weapons, maps, camos, soldiers??? And download stops too while in a match.",4
"This game is awesome very much good but please make all the multiplayer, battle round, team death match please make all the mode in third person view",5
"For A Past Few Seasons, MP Has Been An Absolutely Horrendous Experience. It Is Not Playable At All, There Is Network Lag Every Few Seconds, Which Makes Playing This A Miserable Experience (And No My Wifi Is Pretty Stable)",1
Worst game in the history Endless glitches Every update brings new issues and lag and glitches. Now the timeout issue is another thing. Wish i could give a 0 star. You devs are mdrfukrs,1
I did up date then found out you put me right back near the beginning on my rank so the amount of money I spend on this game for what. I want to delete my account because this isn't the first time this game has done it to me,1
My account has been hacked and the moderators never could help me. It sucks because the person entered my account and used all my CP and changed my nickname. I don't feel like playing this game anymore. It's dumb!,1
This stupid game is so trash.I am on lvl 34 and my team's is on the same level as me but the enemy is on lvl 150 so that isn't fair. And all of the enemy's team is on ruby league and diamond League and oth good leagues. Every gun has so much recoil,1
"It's freaking awesome. I like it, pretty cool that we can play with out ps3 or buying it. What more can people ask for right.",5
"I love the graphics, but the game is too much of dawnloads, try to include all downloads when we updating the game, not while playing.",5
"Why bring in grand master levels? I have been a regular player and been legendary 9 times, but don't want to grind so much. It's so much grinding that I don't even want to play anymore.",2
"This is a very nice game. I am playing this game from season 2 and see now is seanon 8, I have open many events and many characters in this game. I will tell this play this game and give good reviews. üòäüòäüëçüëç",5
"What tf happened? Ever since I've done this last update it has constantly been lagging. Why did y'all change the team volume/speaker button? Now I have two that say ""All"".",3
I Can't even play this game on wifi !! It's fine on Data but laggy on wifi although this problem doesn't exist in other games using wifi !! It's the only game i ever played has this kind of problem with wifi,1
Not able to log in stops at.99% even reinstalled 2 times.. same result .. now unistalled finally... Game works on mobile data but says trying to connect to high speed wifi with 120 mbps speed...,1
Would be a great game if the devs would stop the hackers. When hackers run the game it takes away the fun for everyone else. The game is now garbage and will not spend another cent on this garbage!,1
"Was really enjoying the game, but since this new season came out it crashes out. So much so I can't finish a battle.",2
"Pay the game and suffer the pain ,no development for reconnecting the game even when network is smooth u will have ping problem worst experience as all ways ,cp event was crappier as crate coupons gives elite or rare camos of some unwanted grenades worthless for a skin collector player ,worth for heavy spenders",2
"I used to rate this game 5 stars, but now it's 2 because it is obvious that COD devs are not interested in making any new innovation for BR players. You only make new innovations (maps, playing modes etc) for MP modes. Heck, they even got tournaments. As a COD BR fan, I'm really really disappointed. I should rate you guys 1 star.",2
The game is never ready to play. Every day there is a download to be done and I feel like that downloads are often just a batch of new advertising.,2
"Excellent game, amazing graphics Giving it a 4 stars cause it lags sometimes and fps drops . Othervise the game is amazing :)",4
"Ultra fps setting is not unlocked for all devices even for all flagship devices. Ping spikes even with good connection. instead of balancing guns Activision is introducing new lucky draws, there's bunch of mele abusers and still not nerfing mele (mele can kill on one tap) so plz change mele's damage from one tap to 2-3 tap like csgo (even codm B.R) Codm doesn't respect -its players it just want making money on lucky draws- as soon as apex mobile launched the Dev's started making useful changes",2
It's the best game I have ever played best graphics best control best skill learner best player pls play it it will be fun but call of duty should add a way to send cp to other people's with the same cost as normal cp battlepass is 220 cp if u want to send it it want too much 500+ cp that terrible,3
"It is one of the best game for the people who like Playing game which has battle experience, Strategic game the friend zone game. I would recommend you to play this game üòâ",5
Terrible and frustrating game. Full of meta abusers and the only way to enjoy this is to start using meta guns Else enjoy dying. Don't download if you want an enjoyable game. It's a waste of data and time,1
Once again lagging so bad after update it's unplayable. If u want a new phone play it because after playing 20 minutes u will die from excessive lagging at the worst times. Guaranteed you'll be so mad you'll break your phone afterwards!,1
"It is a very good game.but about a half month, everytime I try to log in it says timeout.then I checked my internet it was good.Then I deleted the game and downloaded it Again but same result.",4
CODM is going to become a most trash game ever seen in history because now they have gave the BOTS cool skins like real player f2p players dont get any thing but BOTS got epic skins and guns which are given in crates etc.CODM deserve zero star but the 2 star is for game performance.If they want to continue the game the BOTS should be BOT not look like real enemy.,2
"No. Not anymore. I can't unbare and witness thee lvl 150 player in a multiplayer match while im litterlt st lvl 22. How do you think. That a company which is you, thatt lastes since the 19s made this of a bad system. No man. I'm going back to Roblox fps games.",1
Good games are very much on best graphics.But it runs very slow and the frame drop is also.Now in New uodate Too Much high ping.not playable game now,1
"Playing since the beginning , Been the best experience I could have ever get in a mobile game , and I love other call of duties too , keep it up !!",5
"Game lags and devs only release new skins, it takes them at least 3 month to balance the game and fix the meta but after that the game still has the same meta for another 2 months, but when it comes to new skins the release them as fast as the can.",1
Nothing wrong with the game there are no adds in the middle of the game like other games its fun to play and the sttings are easy to set up so the game is amazing,5
The game the keeps on showing there brilliant game with decent content then ruin it by bringing out lots of rubbish with it if I had this reputation and my designer came a said this is wat I have done I would say your sacked some on the skins for stuff a child could do better that's not a joke either out of all the car skins I haven't likes a single one of them colourful cluttered crud just keep the military style coming out it's not rocket science remember 18 + are adults not kids anymore,3
"It really sucks that you have to play with bots all the time and the only time you don't is when you go against a team of real players against you and your team of bots, really sucksüò°and if you're on a streak they will put undestroyable bots to make you loose all you've advanced so you can pay to upgrade,this game ain't getting a cent from me you cheats üò°also when you're upgrading from master to grand master they put in bots that are undistructible so you can loose your gainüò°the update sucks",1
I love this game but I hate the constant updates with then require you to download maps and audio and other stuff you've already downloaded before.,5
Game is good. But some members only get free CP from COD Mobile. We people spend money and won't even get a single legendary gun or CP. That means people like us play and spend but COD gives free Legendary characters and weapons along with CP is given free as if a partiality. Why can't you give a free Legendary character with a legendary gun and some amount of CP so as we also get some final benifit.,3
"The game has improved alot as I have been playing since season 2 of 2020. But I would request the dev team to check for hackers n cheaters as I have heard that there is a apk. File which they download n implement in the game. I have been following COD Warfare on other platforms n alot of hackers have been noticed n banned but in the mobile app this should also be noticed n banned. If the team do see this review i would request you to check on the Asian server's, thanks",4
The game is good its a mobile game that yoy can play with your friends but the problem is when you play a ranked match after 2 or 3 games it kicks you out and you have a 2 hour ban from playing,2
"Youu filthy idiots,After updating my game is crashing.. thuppuk üí¶üí¶ worst experience..you Nowadays facing problems with lot of bugs.. getting irritating..ü§Æü§Æ Rather than consuming lot of memory,solve the bugs..",1
"I'm currently having an issue with trying to join the game. Everytime im about to log in the app, it crashes and stays frozen. I'm on a Samsung S10 plus.",5
"Have been playing this game for two + years and i would certainly say, its the most luckiest and the best game i have played, very thanks to every devs and artists and everyone in the cod mobile team, keep up the great work ü§ç",5
I've played ever since I got a tablet. It's such a good game. 5 years later I'm still playing now on phone but love the season update most because the new ghost!,5
"WOW!!!!!ü§ëYou guys did amazing on game been trying to buy Playstation 5 for weeks now can only order online, No store in my city has a PS5 anyways, I thought I lived in the United States.... Stumbled across this app & rest is history no PS5 Now!!!!!Thanks GREAT üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç JOBüòãüòõüòùüòúü§™ü§ëüéâüëçüëçüëçüëç",5
I am never downloading this game EVER again. Reason 1 people are hacking and cheating and not playing fair. Reason 2 people killing my teammates anytime I play in any matches and it will be 5 on my te vs 4 and when a another person joins the match it goes from 14 to 8 to 14 for my team and 50 for the opponent team. Reason 3 they are doing stuff not allowed to do by hacks and cheats and it takes the fun out of this game so get rid of the hacks / cheats or ALOT of people will stop playing cod,1
"Did something change? For the past several days, the only maps I get are Crash, Nuketown and Firing Range. Did you take the other maps away from the freeloaders?",1
Its still lagging but worse then before I'm getting tired of this man it's crazy they can get your money but they can't fix the damn game right I'm probably switching to newstate PUBG or apex legends and fix hit registry cuz it sucks apex is way better,1
How can i fix my problem??? I absolutly LOVE the game!!! But i need my game fixed!!! My game kicks me while playing BR!! Ive done a repair on tbe game and reinstalled all the ingame downloads! Ive checked my software updates and all is up to date!!! What is my next step???,4
"After the update i can't open the game and it says downloading configuration failed... Also the voice chat for team member is gone, why would you do that?",3
Game has been super glichy and not giving me the kills I know I should have. Making the enemies disappear and then reapper supper close for them to kill me first. Not a game I'll continue to play let alone spend money on if this issue continues,1
Hi Codm I am a old player of this game so today I got the karambit (shipreck camo) but there is a glitch i guess I am not able to see the camo in the game it just shows the regular base melle even the karambit camo is downloaded please try to fix this will mean a lot to free to play players . THANKS AND REGARDS,4
The game after the recent update has started lagging A LOT. I reduced the graphics on the game but still.. Phone heats up like crazy. I'm not unable to play the game anymore.. üò§,3
i play in pc and no any external any application or any third party plug insis done by me .yet cod keep me outlooged .i have been check whole through system but no any fault i ever found.whats this fix it yar.!,3
"This game is addictive and is totally awesome. Codm is more advance than Pubg. Gameplay is awesome, controls too are easy to learn and graphics are the best in mobile industry and it's a fact.",5
"I don't know where else to ask about this, but what happened to the Call Of Duty Zombies game that I spent like $7 for? Did it just get removed for a bit or is it like officially done and over with? I actually liked playing that game and I genuinely had a lot of fun with it. Really miss that game.",5
"Every time I go to log in, it's trying to make me download the update for season five which I just downloaded when it first came out. I love call of duty but this is baloney",1
"After playing for a while I came into conclusion that : Servers in this game are nightmare, they prioritize some players over others in a match for unknown reason (sometime my team is priorized and winning easily, sometimes the oppenents are). Second the term ""Mobile"" in CODM is mostly irrelevant the game is infested with PC players using emulators (their combat pattern is recognizable) but as long as they are another cash cow Activision doesn't care about fair play. CODM is worse than PAY2WIN.",1
"I was fined for exit from the match but I didn't do it, I just got a phone call and when I tried to return to the match I just couldn't. Bad optimisation and donated skins with advantages like additional scopes",1
"Great game but a couple issues. 1) Scorestreaks need to be acquired less easily. It's just obnoxious mayhem with zero skill required so it's not even enjoyable to play. 2) The player needs to be shown details of their death in Battle Royale. Just like multi-player, you should get to see a replay from the killer's side as well as the killer's loadout‚Äîat least one of these. Kills can be very questionable otherwise.",3
"The game is good and overall but the major problem it has is, whenever the enemy fires it doesn't correspond with their movement, it looks like firing in the sky but they shoot you. This made me loose large number of matches",5
"Can't get enough of the game, its addicting. Just love COD mobile, the only thing that really begs me is I have to download the all the everything again when you change season why not download the new fertures and let us keep what we already had. But it's still the best game ever. Thank you BloodieReddude",5
"It's a great game but the amount of bots is horrendous. You can get slung into matches when they're almost already over. You can kill people and the game doesn't register it so your kill count stays at zero while the opposing teams kill count shoots up. The only way to get good guns is to pay so F2P players end up at a severe disadvantage. However, it is very interactive and every now and again you get an evenly matched game where you really have to work for your kills to win which is fun.",3
Terrible updates! This has been a great game before. But as of lately my account was accessed from a different location apparently. Now my name was changed and all my settings great right smh... Also now the game has nothing but bots. Bots after bots its basically a useless game. Please Fix!,4
"‚ö†Ô∏èadd 90 FPS and 120 FPS option, üå¶Ô∏èAdd weather/nature related effects & creatures in mp & br maps (WITH SOUND EFFECT) üîÜAdd brightness adjustment option in setting menu, üì¢Add more commentry/announcement,üí•Add destructive/explosive environment (like BATTLEFIELD), Remove automatic healing power of non living objects from maps (ADD REALISM) add more vehicles/flying stuff attached with weapons, ADD MODERN/ADVANCE/PC STUFF,remastered maps, PERMANENT ALCATRAZ, 6 attachment option, üõ©Ô∏èAir/sky fight.",5
"Bought a limited offer, cp + a specific crate. It was bugged, not a big deal, contact support. Finally get my cp and crate, and it's a completely different crate with nothing I want in it. Now support acts like they can't do anything about it. If you wont give people what they paid for, at least give their money back",1
"Awesome game but question is it possible to make it compatible with Nintendo switch bt controllers, also can you add gun game just some ideas.",5
"This game is by far the best realistic shooting game anyone can play, good graphics even on a low end phone and it has every moves you need to perform. Love it",5
"Previous version of this game was excellent recently i updated COD with latest version and it start hanging, it will take a lot time to login only and some time it failed after multiple attempt of login. Very poor version.",1
"Developers this game is framing and I'm playing on a brand new gaming phone. The damage in this game is bad I was playing against my cousin I shot him in the back and it had no effect on his HP at all and then when I press the fire button to shoot, Mt gun doesn't shoot at all and I'm playing on a new phone please fix this",1
The game is to lagi the frame rate decrease to 25 fps we'll playing the game.It is a large game my phone can't handle it. The game provide with a unnecessary power and advantage which make game lagi and the battle royale sucks compare to pubg there is no fear emotions when u are alive in last zone the power makes very easy to play they should remove the power's and make the game more enjoyable with no power or advantage,2
"This game is very good but it requires like 10GB of storage and that's alot of storage, this game would be 5 star if it had less storage and added more events and exports. Hopefully the game could have some changes and balances in the game hope you read this devs.",4
"Wow, hope it's the only thing you want pn your phone!! For a MOBILE game, this is ridiculous, I have had to erase so many things on my phone on every update. This is getting insane. Im done. This takes way too much space.",1
"Better than ps4 i can get into a game quickly and meet up with friends, very stable game, enjoyed it for months, never thought I'd get into cod again. Thanks to the developer's, would be good to get zombies back.",5
Really good graphics nice weapon customization and over all really like the console games but one problem sometime it randomly kicks you out of the games so that's what I give it a 4 star rating that's all,4
The only game I've spent most screen time on but bug issues every now and then. I still love the game tho. I gave it 4-star cos it lags even on high end devices not everytime but it does,4
"I'm surprised how many just look at graphics and go ""This is amazing"" and put on a 5star review. The graphics are fine when you don't get lagged, which is always their servers, cause they never fixed desync. Gameplay is dead. Bots in ranked mp matches, bots flooding BR matches, you'll be lucky if you have 12 live people. Gameplay is broken just like controls. Maybe if y'all invested in blocking VPNs and emulators when it first dropped it wouldn't be the second coming of the fail that is pubgm.",1
"Minimum requirement for the game is 2gb ram, but yet we 2gb ram users can't even play due to excess lags .... Can't you guy like create a lesser graphic option or something to reduce game lags for we the 2gb ram players ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è..... I personally don't need game graphics or quality, all I want is lag free high fps gaming... I hope you guys see this thoüòíüòí",1
Great visual mayby some what inrisponsive from time to time. And can't use more than two inputs. I have one of those triggers for screen but if I press it while aiming and moving I can't shoot. And if I do screen locks up and can't play until I lift all my fingers off the screen. Pretty game breaking and bothering if you play ranked.,5
"Edit. Lowered from 4 stars . Every time I play a regular br ,,I get a black screen. I can still hear everything,but cant see. I have to close out the game and log back in to hope I'm still alive. #fixyourgame",4
"Awesome game love it, but resently begin to have bugs. Like completely shuts off app in middle of game, sometimes it would just load and load on repeat.",5
Amazing game but needs a good device every update the game become more laggy they must care about optimazation because the is unplayable in low end devices (like mine so i can not play it right now) .,5
"The game is awesome to play but there is a bug, everytime the game disconnect from the server automatically but then I get a penalty and my points are deducted.please fix this asap and I'll give it 5 star's",2
This game is very interesting as I was happy with all modes of it. This is one of the most hit game on PS4 and Xbox I play cod mobile as well as cod other PS4 n PS5 games. But I am more happy with mobile edition. I hope this review will be helpful for viewers and players. Thank you....,5
"At first cod mobile wasn't a pay to win game ,well ,after they started making money they got too greedy and changed to a pay to win game where the guns you buy with 4k or 5k will have more accuracy and attachments than the regular guns ,and this game is full of glitches starting from perspective glitches to desync...and the mechanics in this game where you can literally and run and slide and shoot with accuracy where as if you're shooting the person sliding ,the shots don't register. Horrible e",1
It's fun until you hit a point where your whole teams bots who can't get more than a handful of kills all game and you're getting dik kicked by people using controllers sliding around cause they can't afford a console to be sweaty on,2
I would have given it a zero star in view to the fact that I updated it in the morning and while returning to the game it shows version not updated when I came back here there is no option of update its show either play or unistall. I unistall it and then again install it but still the problem is same. Pls help me out,1
"This is a great game but why you guys won't bring out the legendary guns that haven't came back out like the dream crystals or better yet you guys should make all the guns available at a set price I'm a Pharo user and been waiting for this one to come out for over 2 years, it is very unfair to other gun users and should be updated so we all can have the gun we like also we should have more loadout slots if you guys going to keep bringing out new guns please let these things be available soon",2
BUGGEY MOBILE!! when its not cheaters its hackers. And when your not a paying player your controls are locked and you cant run jump slide as effeciently as we were able to a few seasons back without being paying players. Every game mode people cheat and take advantage of bugs that activision WILL JUST NEVER FIX. The player base has droped so drastically that you start a game with bots then pro players or cheaters replace the bots mid game and your whole lobby gets RUINED!! Game is not worth it,1
I love this app! My system lags at times and people tend to cheat. I could do without the glitches but overall I am a FAN .,5
interesting game/hobby but the problem is the crouching is too sensitive specially when you need to run and slide continuously..the result is you've always caught by the enemies bullets! üòî üòü üò¢ üò≠,5
"One of the the most realistic games I've ever had the privilege of being apart of, the one thing that would help with this game is the server could be a little more up to do ate on not glitching or kicking folks off that are in a match I've been kicked off about thirty times since I started playing but other than that this games deserves five stars.",5
"The game is not starting now, show me the some error and asking to connect device to a stable internet. My internet connection is fine... Help me out on this... Anyone knows whats going on???",2
Best game there is. If you don't fall asleep during the start load up screen. Seriously. Get a pillow and some hot coffee to stay awake. You're going to need to get comfortable. It's sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow,3
"Good game, it allows you to change your settings that can suit your gameplay and has everything in a shooting game you will need. Addictive and fun.",5
"It would be perfect if all the resources kept installed when there's an update, it's annoying and a waste of time download everything all over again everytime",3
The best shooting game so far but it does lag sometimes but not a lot this is a really fun game I play it all the time with my family but it does take a long time to update but besides that it's amazing u should try it.,5
Ive spent money on this game quite a bit and since this new update i cant get in the game. I get a loud buzzing sound when trying to login and then the game crashes ....its not right i have the battle pass and i cant earn cause the game wont let me in to play Now i have to uninstall and reinstall just to play smh Since then bug has been fixed but i am lowering my rating for the disrespect from support/ help section of game.,2
Too many glitches now in Battle Royale bullets are not registering I don't know what's going on but it worked good for the first 2 days and now optimization is all over the place for Call of duty mobile,1
This game is so awesome!! I love it! Never miss a day of playing it for at least one round. And I have spent some money on it but not alot. It is possible to maximize all your weapons and add various avatars to your inventory without spending! I am at level 150 and have all weapons possible maxed out. I really suggest giving it a try!,5
This game is good but the logic of this game sucks like just fix the logic of this game and ever time I go in a team death match or Frontline my score is the top but then a person with a lower score gets 1st place like why!?,4
"Great game brilliant graphics enjoyable chat when you are in the correct Clan, CODs only downside is the amount of physical memory it takes up on a small device like my phone 40Gbs to date, I have enjoyed this game very much for almost 3 years and can see many more years of enjoyable COD to come, Keep up the good work guys..üëç",4
I had problem with the last update!!! Activision come on seriously !!!! Before the update that it take 1.5 gb I mean its toooo much space that take ... I'm talking about the problem that I had ... The sensitivity its been so bad .. I need to toutch about 2 time on the screen to move the camera sensitivity ... Activision fixxx itttt,1
Can't download the new update and after deleting the game can't even download the game again. I have a Ram of 6GB and free space about 20 GB still can't download.,4
"The game is VERY fun and AWSOME but some stuff I don't like #1 it takes like 20 minutes to get to lobby and sometimes it kicks me out so here I am waiting 2 hours just to get in multiplayer lobby.#2 y'all NEED to bring old zombies back it was so much fun and that big monster in the middle so much fun I was CRYING because y'all took em away,#3 I have not been able to play GUN GAME my fav moad for EVER.#4 EVERY PERSON IS TRASH AT THE GAME LIKE SOMETIMES PEOPLE SHOOT THE GROUND AND ARE BLIND. Itsuc",2
"Codm please respond to me asap. I love the game so veruch I enjoyed every moment since I started playing it, but the'invalid parameter' bug I'm facing since a week and I can't even play the game anymore, why is it like that, no matter what I do the game doesn't startüò≠. I restarted it 100s of times , resetted my network, reinstalled the game but I can't still start a single game, over that now that I have reinstalled the game I see all my process for grindable camos has disappeared üôèüèº plz help",5
Best mobile game so far to me‚úåÔ∏è...but the only problem which is absolutely annoying is the updates and downloadsüò£üò£.. Why do we need to download something which has no added value to the gameü§¢ü§¢ The downloads takes alot of time moreso when we 'i' use Mobile data which makes me to be really annoyed but I enjoy this game ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è Will change rate only if you reduce this unnecessary downloads,3
"Like this game soo much,I don't know who made it but,really I just started downloading the game and the as some great graphics and that's all.",5
"Dont like this game because of many reasons. I have been playing more than 2yrs. Meele over powers launchers, grenades etc.. Meele single strike kill makes players always at a disadvantage. You can't expect a professional play. High fire rate weapons, high mobility.. I can go on complaining. I don't wanna play this game hence uninstalling now. Lets see if COD comes up with some plan to have some sense in playing.",1
"I used to think PUBG was everything great about BR Games, until I met this one. Highly satisfied with everything. From sound, graphics, competitions, maps, fonts and just about everything. The only worry I always have is losing my current phone. Big ups to the Dev team.",5
"I love this game, but why the hell do I have to download all the maps all over again after the updates?!! This is the only annoying thing about this game Edit: after the new update I've downloaded it for the third frikkin time and it's still not updating!!!",1
"Hi, I love call of duty all of time, I am fan from basic version of this and really injoy that,but not in mobile version,not completely, some cheaters, hackers stop us from injoy game and bug and lag in the game ,so please do something about it untill you have players yet!!! thanks",4
One of the best games I have experienced... but with the new update yall lower the graphics on my phone it was awesome graphics now is trash. When yall fix that I will rated 5.,1
"Just changed to 1 star. Bring back the body count percentage sucks. What are we playing for?????????? Not a percentage, a body count. What is this a game for? Figuring out interest rates or dietary calculations? I thought we were playing a combat game. Bring back the body count yesterday already. Also, how can a slacker or bot who doesn't have a single kill get a percentage??????????????????",1
Loading error. I updated the game and now once it gets uploaded it doesn't show the play screen.,2
"Every time i connect a controller, it lags super bad. Extremely frustrating. Terrible game. Game is constantly crashing. Y dont yall fix it??",1
"For the new update, I am really disappointed. It is becoming PUBG day by day. Graphic ruin game play ruined everything like Pubg now. People play pubg because that requires less RAM and space but We play codm for the graphics quality movement and strategy. But my addiction is gone now. This was one game loved after GTA 5 and you now ruined it. Now new issue is lagging...too much of lagging",1
"Still a good game but they have made the TTK way too fast for most weapons that the game cant keep up and now they have bots in ranked, even as high as grand master whcih you should never okay aginst a bot in ranked. Still a great game and I recommend it as best FPS multi-player.",4
The game is really cool.....when are you guys paying for playing the game ....we always use data to update the game use data to play the game investing in it but we get nothing back you guys are making a whole lot of money and you can't just pay some small amount for our time on the game is really bad do something about it,4
"Pretty nice game for mobile, The graphics, Gameplay and some other cool skins The only thing that's weird is that even though I don't ""pay to play"", I get a lot of weapon skins every day which I don't care about. But there is one more problem, it's the audio. The audio sounds very weird, I can't even describe how it sounds. That's why I deducted a star.",4
This game is completely a scam. If u observe the people who do not have a premium account their phone hangs when they r shooting at a premium player until then everything is fine.,1
"Amazing graphics and interesting game play. Only issue we face is we get frequent huge updates, that makes the gameplay slow sometimes.",5
"From Yesterday, the game does not load. I have been playing from an year but I don't know what happened with this game. I uninstalled the game and downloaded it again and still the same issue. It keeps on loading for about 5 minutes and then the app closes.",5
It is very nice game it has given me a next level gaming experience üòâ it gives me free skins of anything I have reached 150 level and I am glad to have many skins non like any other games we have to buy battel pass . The is war zone also but atleast one new small map in BR,5
Top notch gaming experience with adjustable controls for easy navigation.,5
"So wonderful game but I have few suggestion for you: please add sniper challenge for ever, don't set time. please add more maps in battle royal because these two map is so tried, because everyday we play same map. I hope you accept my suggestion.",5
"So far so good. Updates are cool. Just having some issues in game. Played 10 matches, 8 out of 10 had me kicked out mid-game for no reason. Issues with connectivity perhaps? Hopefully can be fixed! Big fan!",4
Exceptional. The only problem i have is customization. I feel that atleast a basic one color skin for each gun and weapon would be very good.,5
I've been playing this game for over 4 years first year I was able to get legendary multiplayer and Battle Royale after that call of duty allows hackers to play this game when you play a tournament they do everything they can to stop you from getting past pro at legendary of multiplayer because they don't want that many people playing the tournament since season 3 started I've been on pro for about a week and a half now hackers won't allow you to get past pro 2 call of duty is in breach of cont.,1
"By far the best FPS mobile game out there, with amazing graphics. The sheer amount and variety of content never ceases to amaze me. Every month they give away so much free stuff (especially if you buy the BP). They also listen to the community and balance the guns and scorestreaks every season. If you have good Internet with low ping, you will not experience any bugs or freezes. Most of those are due to bad Internet.",5
The game is great. But after update the game just crashes. I've got a Samsung A02S. Please fix this issue.,1
This game is really good. But it does not much you with people around you lvl. I'm lvl 50 playing with people lvl 150. So I don't really get to play the game. Only thing they really need to fix. Otherwise it's good.,4
It's overall the best mobile game ever but the problem that I have on the new update is that when you switch your primary too secondary weapon it has the screen going up and down every time you switch your weapon I wish y'all could fix this ASAP!!!,5
"this is a really good game, after about a month the proformence drops and it gets a little glitchy sometimes for some players but it's still an awesome way to experience COD without having to have a console or PC. for people looking in the ratings of this game has a glitch where the words on all of the events and buttons are missing there is a quick fix for it, download all of the maps and everything else you need for the game and then close the game and wait an hour and then re-open the app .",5
"I've been playing CODM since S1 2019. Game runs smoothly on iPad. Yeah I know CODM runs great on iPad pro but back then, I played on android phone ( 4G Ram ) , game felt great but after a year , my device started to crash and laggy. Overall Callofdutymobile is an excellent game. Awesome skins and graphics, specially the gameplay is great. But pls fix problems of our low end device players so they can enjoy the game as well üëç",5
"Let me tell you something about this game buddy.‚úåÔ∏èüíÄ It has awesome graphic, good machanism,best gun loadout , realistic guns texture, suitable network, regular updates for optimisation, great battle pass and ectera. You should try that one.üóø",5
I just have to say i love this game alot I hace been playing for over a year now And a love it.I am a good player to.... But i would love to be able to throw a knife like in cod warzone... Why not add the Stoner or something like that very good gun.In the future of this game...i hope to see some real pro type of battle royal and more modes,5
"Game is really amazing, but you should reduce the size of maps, soldiers, and weapon's camos. Please reduce the size it's really difficult to download this much high packs....",5
I've been playing it since 2019 on the mobile they worked a lot of bugs out over the years and it's just a fun app/Game to play especially when you have time to kill but you're going to need a good phone,5
"There are some problem in game . Every time I start the game it shows me time out . After try multiple times I enter the game . Then it start showing wating , reconnecting . At first I thought that was my problem but then I told my other friends they also face the same problem . Please fixed this problem . So that I and my friends can play again .",5
"Good graphics and a lot of fun to play. Love this game. The best mobile game. Just had some glitches during game play, but not very often. I have been playing for bit more than 2yrs.",5
Good game to pass the time but there is still a problem with lag & matchmaking. Don't think they care much instead of fixing any glitches they just add more and more to spend money on. Watch out on being a good player you may get banned and I'm sure it'll be hard to get your account back after trying to prove you're not a hacker. The first thing they'll ask is if you had streamer mode ON if not they won't help you. Imagine spending so much money on the game to just get your account deleted.,2
"I can no longer log in my account through FB, I keep getting Authorization error and I can't create a new account, because I'll lose my 2 year old account. Please fix this error for God's sake... I am less than happy tbh losing so much progress and skins, cp and cod points in the thousands.",1
Not just a game .. we have emotions attached with those resources files . Loving it enjoy it .. and yes some time annoying things happening too .. enjoying every bytes of it . Started alone and have some good friends from neighbouring state . So I m enjoying it .,4
Coming back to the game to play with friends. And after dl the first thing you do is force my profile into a solo ranked... Ridiculous! Already wanna delete again!,1
Great game you can fully custimize your guns to. Amazing graphics! The only thing is that it needs near perfect connection to play or mobile data.,4
"One major problem about this game is the size of the game and it's frequent update. Seriously, I'm really getting tired of it's frequent update. There'll come a time where I will have to delete this game from my phone.. and I'm already feeling like deleting it.",3
Download configuration failed. Issue happening only in call of duty not other games or apps. Internet is working fine. Hence COD does not starts.,1
This game is the best but it lags so much and it pisses me off it mostly lag when im shooting at someone or when a enemy is close to me thats what gets me even more angry lol I wish yall can fix this cause I really enjoy this game I try using the shader preload option but that does nothing I even carry down my graphics and all and that still doesn't do nothing,3
"Game was working fine. But after the new update the game is lagging, I have Cleared all the cache and even tried uninstalling and installing the game again but nothing worked . I have a One Plus 7t Pro McLaren edition so I don't think my phone is the issue here.",2
"This game is one of the best shooter games in the whole world! Amazing graphics and styles, tho the game is quite laggy and the tournament mode timings for middle East is way to early",4
"Last update: Black screen stuck, loading screen stuck, went out of the app, stopped it, the music was still playing for a while, fix ur game pls lmao",3
Game is lagging and freezing too much. I am facing framedrops when i am facing enemies. Both In MP and battleroyal. Plz make gameplay smooth. I have Redmi Note 9 Pro 4Gb Ram 64 storage. I play this game for fun but this is giving me headache.,2
"Absolutely great. Really the best choice for fps genre on mobile. Quality visuals, great combat, all the same mechanics from console titles for Call of Duty. Honestly has become my favorite game to play and I own a PC and console. Updates are small and manageable. Matchmaking is fast well under half a minute for most match types. If you use gyroscope aiming and a controller at same time it is a phenomenal experience.",5
Game was great until this last update. It won't let me download the new update && kicks me off everytime. Freezes too way too much.,2
The game is getting a lot better it as grown in development wish I had a offline gameplay though because not every where I go I have wifi so a offline gameplay would come in handy n a multiplayer where u get shot but ur teammates can revive u so it would b fun,4
"I keep getting this ""invalid Parameter "" message whenever I click on multiplayer mode. This has been happening since after upgrade to Season 5",5
"Thank you Activision for a nice game And i would like to bring up ""lagging"" it's getting better but could still use some work, but really I've been playing COD Mobile for close to four years and it's been greatüòÉ and last thing I can't see players at a distance in royal",5
"Soo much space consuming.... Seriously everytime should we need to download the maps and weapon camos and soldier camos...!!!? Ohhh comeon guys plz grow up... It's not an easy thing, almost 10gb it's not a small thing... Again I have to download the maps and soldiers HD audio... Yet the audio is not working properly..",1
"I'm giving five stars cuz the graphics have blown me away and the smooth gameplay is rlly gud. I would like some free legendary or mythic stuff (If u don't mind do for the people who can't afford battle passes, draws and stuff, people like me). Thnx for the epic game! :)",5
Love this game it's everything you could ever want in a mobile game i tried like 100 different games and this is the only one that you can get a ton of great stuff just buy playing and just the customization is amazing the only complaint is it's a bit laggy if you don't have a decent device to play on,5
The graphics are great and loads to do in the game. The only downside is that other plays hop and slide and are faster than bullets Even when they have been shoot making it unrealistic. This could be the best mobile game of all time. But it looks silly watch players hopping about. Please fix this. Thanks,3
"Cod has a better tdm & ranked matches i.e realistic than any other close combat shooting games. Battle royal is good too. Less laggy than pubg & apex legends means, the ping is better than in pubg & other games. P.s the best game in the history of combat fighting. Rating 4.5/5. I give other combat games 3.5 or 4/5. This is the father of war gaming.",5
This was very fun until I downloaded the hd resources pack I downloaded it and I can't still even change my graphics settings upon I restarted the game as told. Better fix this problem.,2
"I love the game. But for some reason, it won't let me log in. Giving a lot of captcha errors whenever I try to log in. Not letting me in. Then it won't send an Email for me to change my password. And when I finally do, it won't let me change it.",4
Keep freezing when opening the app and after you close the app it still plays sound in the background. im on tab s7?,1
I love the gae its fun and I can play with my frends in class but the download is very slow i updated it and its very slower then the download but it stays fun i love it but i miss the zombie mode,5
"A really awesome game but with each update comes more issues like, lag or the game just fails to launch.",4
I would have given 5 stars but actually these methods like airstrikes and that stupid dog and bombs that fall on your head and die without you having any chance to do anything about it it really makes the multiplayer sucks with these stuff in it it would be much better if you would at least make a mode where these weapons do not exist after all it is suppose to be a shooting game and actually all these things has nothing to do with shooting,4
"Super fun to play now, they actually fixed the game when I needed,graphics are awesome, The game hasn't crashed, but in br when I'm playing, sometimes the enemy will be invisible and I see then when at 100 health,that really messes things up,happily I can still kill them at 100 health sometimes, I am finally level 135. Only complaint now is it takes up 13 GB on my tablet, please change that or i will have to stop playin. So fix Those and the game is awesome, YouTube/twitch: INVAZIGODYT",5
It used to be just awesome. But the recent updates have made it sluggish. Earlier it used to be very smooth in high settings. But currently sluggish even in low settings...,1
It's bigger than warzone I can't play it any more/ after some time and upgradeing the phone I downloaded it and u got a lot of campers issues üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéall this was a waste of money and time I want a refund not playing this game any more.,1
Love it all the way but you never should have taken zombies off again. The zombie mode was the only reason i redownloaded it in the first place. Iv been waiting for a new map for a long time now theres no zombies at all plz bring zombies back again or put the old maps on 4 a zombie mode 4 all of us fans,2
I love cod mobile I've been playing this game for quit some time with friends the only problem is. That people should get a chance to buy what the really want and not waste all of their cp in some lucky draw because it takes alot to get those cp and most of the time you don't get what you really want its unacceptable,5
"I've had no issues with this game for about 1 year and 8 months since downloading, till this weekend. Everyone else i know personally in my regional server have access to the new updates CP tournaments except me. I've reported the issue to support but haven't received any news on why my device is not supporting the new update's CP tournament please help.",4
"The game is filled with bugs, fps drops and severe connectivity issues. Also, WHY DOES THE GAME SIZE HAVE TO INCREASE SO DRASTICALLY WITH LITTLE TO NO IMPROVEMENT IN GRAPHICS? Activision really needs to check this with its developers. Update May 2022 : Problems aren't resolved, uninstalled.",1
Why can't I get any updates? I paid for the Battle pass and now everything is gone to waste because I can't access any features. What the hell is this? It says download the latest version but there is no update on the Play Store. Now I can't even play any game. Either refund my money or fix your app.,4
"Once again issues!!! I have an Xbox controller not a PlayStation controller, my layouts and bottoms show as a PlayStation layout and bottoms while connected with an Xbox controller. I've paid for evey damn season man the least y'all can do is make sure your game and system is accurate. I really wish I can give no stars at all. I am so close to going back to modern strike online.",1
"I just love playing codm and currently hyped up about the season 4, I will definitely recommend playing this game, since it's release it has been in my fav games list. But I would definitely recommend nerfing the score streaks and focussing more on the actual gunfight.. Thx activision for codm. I'm still waiting for codm 2 and warzone mobile. Hope to see them soon üòÅ",5
The game is awesome. You should also fix the Google account linking because it always gives an error message whenever I try to link my account,5
It was my favourite game. But COD team has bring many features and game starts lagging. Changing my review from 5 star to 1 star. Going for PUBG. I suggest to remove all unwanted things from game. Bring Adreline and medikit back. Remove that snow man and in games. They are totally useless. Thank you See you in next update,1
"From a black shark 4 pro user, this game runs smoothly and no real lag. Mp and br are both becoming smooth and really addictive. Only a few small bugs.",4
"It lags on a phone with 3 Gb of RAM & a SnapDragon CPU üòè, it doesn't show enemies from a long distance in Battle Royale mode .",1
"super fun since I like all cod but updates take up waaay too much time and if u have an error while updating, even worse. I would suggest u installing and then reinstalling, cuz it takes like a min to install and to update (even with good internet) will take almost 20 mins. And the game size is outrageous",4
"Great game. There are so many modes in multi-player, battle Royale is basically the same goodness we have on the consoles, and there are so much customization. This includes Weapons, characters, scorestreaks, perks, etc. Also the score streak system is really good. The only meh thing about this game is the zombie mode. It's not even difficult it's just a struggle to win it. But other then that COD Mobile is great",4
Honestly the best shooting game on mobile. I rated it 4 stars because of too much lag. On the 5 day of zombie siege my game starts to lag and crash and im extremely angry because I don't get my reward. But beside lag and crashing I honestly enjoy this game 24/7,4
I like this game very much but I still miss the story. Mode in which lots of mission we have to do so please do something,5
This is ultimately a nice game. I also addicted üòúü§ó much . But the game have some bugs i hope the developers will fix soon ü•∫üòä.,5
"it is a very fabulous game i have ever played in my entire life which is pretty and most interesting. They have good weapons and good structure smooth graphics, Whenever i play this game I fell like i am playing in real mode...But should have been betterüëçüëç",5
"It's a game with appearances like call of duty, by using the name, ui, maps, most skins, all guns, theme song etc make it feel real serious; But inside is truly childsplay, with toy gun skins, anime like skins, kill effects, aggressive Movement system, freefire-fortnite-cyberpunk copy, spammers, abusers (Even have aerial jet movements ) Its no way simulation of real world. Most Users love to show boat and abuse Users are forced to play aggressive or as abuser to improve!",2
"I LOVE THIS GAME but I just reinstalled it on a new device and now my username has been forcefully changed from Snapdragon14 to NDZIZjJmNDYOMGY4ZmRI i would like it changed back, this would be fine if you guys weren't trying to charge me to change my name. Anyone know a way to fix this bug, any dev willing to give me my name back???",1
"Very good I love I have it since the og season 1 But there are many problems like high ping strike,lag which it never ends and the the total size of 4.43 GB right now also high end devices are lagging too so maybe activision needs to reduce the game size but anyways I love it i recommend you to download it",5
"Server issues. Couldn't able to connected to the game though I am using super fast wifi.. fix the bug. It's says ""network issue"" after 57% while dynamic resource update",1
I would give 5 stars but I only give a three stars It's a good game but for the past two days I can't seem to get past the main screen for some reason or other please fix this,3
"This game is amazing and ever improving. I like that the nuke animation was changed. One last suggestion tho, perhaps the animation should also be directional, as in the light and even a mushroom cloud would be placed at the edge of the map, and the player angle facing to or from the nuke would also determine the brightness of the blinding effect.",4
"After the latest update, often when I start the game it takes awfully long to load then most of the time it says not connecting to internet even when it is.",4
"With this newest update, the game will not even allow me to do downloads. Everytime I try, it cuts off back to my main screen. So I tried on my fiance's phone... Same thing. I loved this game but now I'm getting very sick of it.",1
"This game is fun but its rigged for me, I saying every 1v1 interaction with a max level player. My game gets delayed every time I try to hit my shots. Which gives the enemys/max players an advatage which pisses me off because I know I could be destroying the game competition but I cant, because Activition/game users slowed me down. If you are afraid of me and my game skill then ban me again,but when you game starts to loose intrest in others, you can endorse me because I can actualy hit my shots",1
"I enjoy playing the game, it's the ads in-between sessions that make me want to put it down, there are to many and they're long. The game is money driven, I get it, so then why so many ads?",4
Game always freezes or hang ..my device is realme 7 pro but then also game freezes . I had mailed to developer not any changes were made and they didnt listen to me..i like this game itmakes mood off when it freezes,2
I can't type more than 500 letters so Ill start here I've been playing this game since release and it just gets worse you basically have to pay to play anyway buying passes opening crates and draws and us people have only the chance to get rewards ever since the new update today I've seen bots wear paid skins and guns the actual hell people have to pay over 200 quid to even get the whole crate or draw now bots get it for nothing bad enough this month cause of bp now I hear voices I want not fai,1
"When the round has started, the other team is already winning even though we just started. We always lose because the other team has one more win to go and it's not fair that the game already started with the enemies with 8 points more then us.",1
It's good but it would be excellent if not for the bugs and the toxic classes like trap master.I am actually going to stop being a member of this game just because of those two issues but other than that the game is good.Unless they do something am getting out of this game.,4
Really good only bad thing is to many sweat other wise known as try hards however you won't see them for awhile. It's a fun game to play with friends especially if you are a big call of duty fan they even put in guns that are from other call of duty games that are on console.,4
"Easily the best production-value fps experience on mobile (only Apex comes close). Wish the controller support didn't feel like playing underwater. Nothing in game is P2W, however CP prices are exorbitant",5
There is some problem with its frame rate optimization in iqoo 9 device . But the BGMI is running smooth on the same. Please fix this ASAP. Thanks,2
Nerf the god damn shotguns in BR. It's all anyone freaking uses change the meta. People also moving with guns in their hand faster that I ever can how isn't that a hack? No even match making in any mode I'm always teamed up with the bot skin teams while I always verse people with very expensive skins. Tell me how that is match making to skill if I'm always the one getting 15 kills in BR and my team get like 4 if they are lucky. Match making is a total scam I'm always matched with losers.,1
The new perk set up... trash... absolutely trash i liked my load outs then you go be trash some more. I can't have nice score streaks and good perks yeah keep ruining your game...,1
Its starting to suck because my game has given me for the 10th time no enternet connection but I have full bars and I have restarted my phone 2times and reboted my wifi 4times . Looks like Apex over lapped Activision,1
Its awesome dude....but today it's not working properly showing network error but my network is completely perfect !!! Help me out !!,5
Probably one of the best online games i have ever played the graphics are splended but only one problem why cant i put the graphics up a notch but never mind the is over all amazing thank you so much keep up the good work,5
It's an amazing game alot of fun the multiplayer is fun but the Battle Royale mode is very easy most in Royale are AIs and only a handful are real players. But there one reason I put it at 4 star and that is I can't see any charcters in multiplayer I only see the one you spawn with (Black ops 2 Assault Rifle Seals skin) or the lady from black ops 3 who use the bow. I can't see the other skins every gets and the only time I see their skins us when you see the top 3 players...Can you guys fix this,4
Be adding waste and big map which no one play and because of this it is soo high GB am a low end device player and only like me low end device player can understand how lag it is ... I spent over 2K in this game ! Now i think i should deleted or my phone would die please i have request that remove this big maps and add map like shipment... Please CODM official üôèüôèüôè i know that there's no chance that CODM official are reading this but if you are then please remove map . This is a very good game,1
I been playing for years and invested money in this game and I can't play anymore because These update take up more and more room each go. I just updated awhile ago and deleted all I could.. sucks I can't play nomore. You could at least give us the option to still play.,3
Well when i was playing Call of duty mobile just fine but since season 3 came out i can't even log back in because it keeps on saying timeout it never happened before when i started playing it and now it's not working please fix the problem. And I'll put five stars,1
"This game is so cool and I recommend it to every mobile gamer but the only thing I dislike about it is after installing a huge size of 2 GB of game, you have to download the maps separately and there are frequent updates, like 3-4 a week üòí",4
"I started playing cod mobile shortly after the release date this season had a glitch and my order for $4.99 was charged $49.99 upon completion of a refund my account is not accessible and every purchase I made over the last 3 years with it over $3,000 in purchases gone and no response from support So I guess the people behind this game are nothing but thiefs don't buy anything on this app they can take it for a simple refund request.",1
"I've tried to download this game 7x before and I can't seem to figure out why I can't play the game!!! """" --All it's really been doing is that this game is not available to download or play because the software doesn't support your device and then it crashes automatically every time and I don't know why It's saying that because I had it before on this device and now I'm just running out of patience and I'm not really happy with this situation.. ANYONE KNOW WHAT TO DO-- """"",5
"Great game and lots of fun. But not super friendly to F2P players. Over 90% of items u would want or that are cool are all pay to win. And it limits free 2 play by a huge majority. Even apex has better drop rates and u can actually earn rare and cool stuffs by playing F2P. CoDM on the other hand u would have to spend 100's of dollars for 1 rare item. Not worth it, learn to become more F2P friendly or Apex finna take over again fr fr. CoD is losing majorly right now. Sorry but that's the truth.",1
"Do someting with hackers and cheaters. This game is hackers paradise. Reporting system seems like doesn't work at all. Hitting the enemy with knife 3 times a row and he survived, this is OK in this hackers game I guess. The game is so hard nowadays, and the reason is, every kid who can't win the game, just enable mods and use config files, as simple as that. Activision seems to like hackers and cheaters. I even have video captured when someone running tru walls, this is not fun anymore.Fix it",1
"After downloading update,i am not able to start the game, showing error. Please help although i will lost my data. Please see in this matter please",3
"I don't like to rate 5 stars most apps aren't worthy, this game is amazing and you can actually play it and not feel like you have to spend money to get anywhere",5
"Hello. If possible, speed up the gameplay of the multiplayer and Battle Royale sections, as well as remove the third-person mode! Because this mode really insults the roots of the Call of Duty series!",5
Terrible Autofire option!!! Im in love with this game!!! üëåüèøüëçüèøüßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí´üí´üí´üí´üí´ Five stars!! I often compare this FPS to ShadowGun Legends. As a player I feel as if Autofire should be tweaked a bit because it reacts 5 seconds slower than free fire player which gives you a gigantic disadvantage.,2
"This game is super fun to play with, the guns are super awesome!, and it's very easy to play, but the reason I rate it only 4 is because it takes a lot of space storage.",4
"I love playing this game but I don't like updating the game especially when it's 1 gb. It'll reach 100 percent then stays there and starts back to 0 out of nowhereüòî so I'll have to restart on download other then that, it's worth the play!",4
"This Game is so much Trash Every Season You need to download same maps again & again, After 2More Years this trashcan will be more than 64GB do you want people to buy a separate phone for this game ??",1
"I don't get why it's so expensive to get a lucky draw gun... Especially when on the console cods it's way cheaper to get anything...this game used to b great but honestly I'd rather play Fortnite or PUBG cuz it's way cheaper to get stuff u want. And on top of that zombies has way too many bugs now, cuz u guys just add more content but never fix any problems with the game. I heard this game was a test run for your next mobile game but, honestly no one will play it if u do the same thing.",1
I love this very much I played since the first ever season but I lost account becuase of my phone is destroyed but overall I love this game just issue about lag and being kick out of the game I think u making the tournement event was a very thoughtful idea I thank you very much for your effort it is now even better for free2play player but keep up the work,5
"Call of duty mobile weapons aiming capability is bad and damaging enemy body parts capability is high so I not kill assault Rifles, or smg or sniper. Sniper aiming very bad and damaging bad but sound quality is best for enemy inform for knowing weare is place firing foot steps are very loudly not options for slowing steps. When I fire to correct aim but not heat enemy body I more firing but not kill.So that I say to cod developers please real aminng feel make it an more attachment option.t",1
"Now, I'm a massive fan of the game, can't really fault it. What I can fault, is the number of and size of the updates! You guys are on a joke ting. Fix up. Even over fibre its long and wayyy too regular. Why does your app deserve that much real estate on my phone? I'm done.",2
"The game is becoming more and more larger and it seems only high end devices can play smoothly with no lag or frame drops, the game should be optimized for more low end devices",2
Amazing game! Love playing against people from all over the world! Learning new tactics and loadouts to win and better xp in every map and mode.,5
"This game is better thanBGMI ,free fire ,Apex legend ,Battle field and ping new state. op game And this game is better graphic than pubg new state and Battle field. This game is a next level of new update.",5
"If you wanna drop 80 on a gun, cause they got one ur effed. And wanna pray it don't get laggy a/f when interacting with opponents go for it....I have gaming tablet it's not me it's this game",2
"Aside from some lagging issues and voice chat issues; this game is awesome.... And Ive noticed that androids are joined into the game last, causing some frustration when picking a class in br; otherwise-awesome game",4
I just like to play the game. There is way to many places to navigate to. My biggest issue is I have been banned with no explanation. I have tried to contact the creators and there is no distinct way to do that so I just made a new account. I want my old account back.,3
You guys really need to work on this game it lags aot after an update and all the downloaded maps starts all over again. I would be grateful if if you could work on that too,4
I love how easy it is for people to hack this game then you completely loose control of your guns and everything. And I like how the creators allow it. This game glitches so bad oh you just spawned in but the game didn't load fast enough haha well now your dead fix the damn game.,1
"Not user friendly. It's allowing loging, always showing ""Network Error""(4A28) funny thing is I'm having 100mbps broadband speed internet service üòÅ. I came to know that why this game got failed in race for game like Pubg. Worst experience. Uninstalling now.",1
Pretty awesome in spite of the cheaters. If you have a mid range device it will run and plays like console or PC. Now if they could fix the rampant cheating.,4
"The world stupid game I've ever played. They even can't optimize the server in 3 years and they are thinking that's it will be a no 1 game lol. That's why I'm leaving coz of their stupidity, glitches and bugs ü§¨",1
Its a really really awesome game.dont know how to say it but i figured out a problem that there is a auto download the resource pack when we connect the wifi it took a bunch of my internal storage.so please make a option to stop auto downloading,5
"I been playing this game since 2019 and is still my favorite game on the play store, there's constant updates and they keep the game fresh by adding new content and by taking feedback from the community and the best part is that is not pay to win like most games out there. I highly recommend you give it a go!",5
"I have not had access to any of the lethal or nonlethal equipment for some time. It puts me at a huge disadvantage. I have reported this on multiple occasions without anyone caring apparently...update, still ongoing problem",1
Can't get off from this. Graphics and Animations are superb. Gameplay is something I am hooked up to and can't miss out to play each day. If only the BR had more participants like a 100 and MP had 10 vs 10 mode !!!,4
This game is very good game but i gave it 4 stars because it take a lot of storage to install. I think its the best mobile game right now and i am also excited for call of duty 2 warzone mobile. Best of luck activision for making the call of duty 2 warzone mobile.,4
"Four women fight their way through Apocalypse, but nothing can prepare them for the sinister secrets they‚Äôre about to uncover in Call of Duty: Mobile Season 5: Tropical Vision!

Grab the new Oden - Megalodon and toss an echo grenade to get the jump on enemies behind cover! Will hidden enemy tech disrupt her visions of revenge? Start the trek!",5
"Game keeps on hanging once during all every BR matches. Need to restart and rejoin in the middle of the game which makes us lose the battle almost every time. Using a powerful device, tab s6 devs need to find a solution...",5
I love cod mobile and I would have given 5 stars but for one thing .. I do think you overprice some of the characters items crates it's near impossible to get a legendary weapon .. I spent over ¬£60 on a crate drop but still didn't get the weapon !! Really annoying,4
"In Sniper mode, all player should use the same scope, I seen other player with better scope which give them faster scope in for the kill. Sniper Mode 2 star...",2
I give it 4 stars cuz there's some laggingn issues.needs more guns and blueprints for the non pay-to-play players. Need too be able to changes loadouts after getting killed without having to go into the settings and doing it in the middle of a game .could be more ways to earn the CP Credit or whatever its called but other than little tweaks here and there this is an amazing game. I recommend it to anyone that's a big Call of Duty fan,4
I love the game bin playing for years and the new update ruined it it won't even get past log in it shows its connecting to Facebook then freezes please fix,1
"Every time I get on this game, I have to install something. It takes too much data. So then I delete other apps and photos.",1
So far been an exciting game. Realistic gameplay similar to each call of duty predecessor. Very much happy I downloaded the game.,5
I think its a pretty fun game in the beggining its easy but after like 25 to 30 levels it starts to get difficult but the graphics are still really good so its a really fun game in my opinion,4
"This game may have good controls for a first-person shooter on a smartphone, but everything else about Call of Duty: Mobile is AWFUL. Painfully dull limited-time events with insipid objectives that flat out do not work, overly aggressive microtransactions, UNBELIEVABLY broken matchmaking and weapon balancing, all of these issues and more show just how far this game will GENUINELY go to screw you over in almost every single way imaginable. DO NOT waste your time with this frustrating trash.",1
"The basics of the game are great. If your gonna spend a lil money on draws to get cool stuff prepare for disappointment. I've spent so much and gotten very little in regards to getting desirable items low spend ""draw boxes"", but!!! unless you like parachute, grenade, cycle, boat & grappling claw skins then get ready to cream yourself. If your blessed with stupid cash, then run it. You shouldn't have any trouble getting high desirable items. Low spend= b.s. not cool. High spend= ohyah way cool.",3
Nice game and the graphics are too good I never thought this type of graphics on mobile. I never bored of this game it is different than pubg I have play many cod games and I love it very much and in battel royale. The controls are very easy to understand and I request codm to add some loadout to the game like 15 loadouts......,5
"Ever since the latest update my game wouldn't load and I would have to get put and back into the app to get in and play, now I can't even enter and actually play the game anymore I don't understand why!?",1
"This Royal battle game is awesome, graphics quality is nice when compared to other battle games, actually this is pc game but in this version launch from mobile, in this game challenge to mobile processor like my poco x3 8gb ram. I give five star, star's is not important but game is minimum to below 1 gb data other mobile gaming lovers are not interested cod, because download mb is too much 2.2 gb. Thanks for giving üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",5
I've loaded this game several times and I'm still unable to play it because it keeps crashing and I can get it to even go to the profile that I've been using for 2 years with all my characters and and weapons and now I can no longer access it so I'm trying to get this one more time if it doesn't work out well then yeah or no,5
This game is a very good game and very good graphics graphics outside the barrier a good game play and everything and and awesome levels and Tess's you have to get through to get higher up in it and it's just a great game out there for games for computers,5
This game is the best I game I played its so fun specially when your mad when you kill players you feel satisfied üòå you can invite friends play in one team or against each other it gives you score and level and in the end who is the best player some times it's me,5
Need improvement in classic mode update showing 1.5gb but it takes more than 2gb for update after 100% additional 500mb ?? Due to this problem downloaded 3 times just wasting time for their wrong information felling angry,1
Bring back the option to not play against controller players if you play or phones normally. There is no reason they shouldn't have separate lobbies for this as controller is a clear advantage over literal fingers.,2
This game ranked mode is dead as soon you get to Masters 1 you can't find a match how am I supose to get higher rank if I can't find a match? This is so annoying I usually have to wait like 2h to find a match and even of I do so most of the time there is one player missing and the match is canceled,2
"Usually a solid game, but now it's only playable using data which is worse than it sounds. Tried connecting to different WiFis and reinstalling everything but it still results in rubber banding and disconnecting from the match. As someone with experience in coding and having a degree in cyber security, I'm curious as to why so many call of duty games have been rendered unplayable recently",2
"To end all complaints on Classes in BR being nerfed; COD Mobile should ADD a Battle Royale where there are NO CLASSES, NO PICKUPS OF ANYTHING ON THE GROUND & NO DROPS. You start with your 2 custom weapons (max ammo) and max Backpack full of YOUR goodies.Then, we'll REALLY see who's ALL SKILLS. Better shots, loadouts, and movements WIN. Looting of others you've killed boxes will be the only way to reload on ammos and such. If you are reckless and blast all your ammo away, with NO kills, you Melee",4
"I upgraded my 3 star review to 4, because the game doesn't refer to magazines as clips anymore. I held off on the 5th star because too many costumes are, well, nothing I'd ever wear in the field if I wanted to survive. Secondly, picking up gear in the field makes no sense: you should go into the field with full gear. Lastly, it would be great if there were full environment specific battles (winter warfare, jungle), and longer times in large battle zones, and randomly generated maps.",4
"I actually was enjoying the game for a while. But then all of a sudden I was getting killed repeatedly with impossible ease. Now I find that people are hacking this game too. I got rid of Warzone on my pc for exactly the same reason. Unless you want to play strictly with bots (which is ridiculously boring), don't even bother with it. The game itself wasn't so bad but the talentless feebs that need to hack to get ahead, absolutely ruined the experience. Uninstalled. Not looking back.",1
I was playing these from last 2 years But from last month it is so frustrating My network is good but it says Check your internet connection only got login when use wifi not able to login on cellular network Why üò≠ it makes me to delete these game 3 times,1
Truly unfair ranked match making. Worst gaming experience. Graphic is good but match making is horrible. Specially in ranked multiplayer.,1
"üéáüéáAdd Lobby Background Music In Game With On/Off Button. Great Job. Gaming Experience Is Very Batter. Background Music Is Very Sad And Very Nice Music For Survival. Call Of Duty Game Experience Is Like Pubg Lite And Free Fire Same Experience. Jungle Forest Is Very Beautiful. But This Game Is Smoothly Not Run In 4Gb,3Gb Ram Phone Or Low End Device. ""Thanks""üéÜüéÜ",5
I open the game after a long time when I launch it says I am level 14 I was level 100 . And all my stats and guns that i have unlocked has been reset,1
It's very interesting game high quality graphics and natural effect but one tra back there are soo many options are there some confusion to handle for more than one month for new gamersüôÇ,4
"Love the game it is just even though i downloaded the whole thing all the updates everything all i can see is special ops 1 and green outrider, please fix this bug before next update.",4
"There is a problem with the update it had. I wanted to inform you earlier but i didn't get time. The new rarity formula, in which all the guns are equal (except mythic) and the perks are different, is not that much fun to play. I loved the old idea of rare guns, epic guns etc. So i kindly request to bring back the old formula. It was more fun. Otherwise it is awesome",3
Walking lock always turns on when I don't want it to now with this new update. It will lock and not let me unlock it and it messes up my ability to play the game.,3
"Digital purchases. Imagine grinding to rank up and getting a crate only to get digital garbage. Unless you pay over $130 dollars to get this really cool weapon and skin. Yeah, doesn't reward for grinding so, thanks Activision",1
"Call of duty is an excellent game, probably one of the best FPS for mobile out there, The battle pass is very affordable (less than $5) and incredible skins from lucky draws !! I certainly don't have alot of issues with the game aside from a few lag issues, minor bugs here & there. I definitely Recommend for new players (people)....... 4/5 üåüüåüüåüüåü",4
"Hey, i absolutely love this game.But, the only thing i want here is the Chopper Gunner being added into the Credit Store. I dont know how to get the chopper gunner except when using the Care Package, and i really want the chopper gunner because wjth a care package it would be harder for me to get a Chopper Gunner. OR Add it into ghe Credit Store. Overall greatest game ever, thanks for making this game, Activision.",5
The game is great and wonderful to play to relax or to pass some free time but my issues are 1) the game sticks and lags a lot when a lot of players are in the game at once like 10 Vs 10 matches and battle royal 2) the constant updates and downloading is making me think twice about keeping the game on my phone because of the amount of space it is taking. Please try to fix this problem.,3
"Overall great game,and If possible I would play it daily ,but for some odd reason lately the loading screen comes up and boots me back to my phone's home screen after it loads up to 99 percent...what could be causing this issue",5
"Played this game for awhile, won alot of BR games. Got a new phone and can't use my main account because it was a guest account I guess. So no more mobile for me I guess.",1
Too many bot and way too many with cheat programs running. They need to up their security and get rid of the bots. Still allowing people with cheaterprovrams to control the game maybe microsoft should give ownership back to blizzard activision no teal customer support takes days for a response never fix the the sound glitch that thousands have reported cuts out in ranked matches causing losses an lost points.,1
Wonderful game love to playing always but after new update now game lagging so much in my Redmi note 10 i can't play game properly so mush lag can't play many times can't move charector freezing on place because of to much lag and frame drops and also sometimes signal drop problem and some bugs,3
This used to be my favourite mobile game before these massive updates started rolling in. Now it's filled with bugs and a whole lot of lag. I remember being able to play at a high frame rate and now all of a sudden I'm locked to medium only. If you don't want to release a lite version at least work on making the game playable even to 3GB RAM users. Y'all can really do better than this. Sometimes visit the CODM Facebook group and see how much people complain about what I've mentioned here.,3
"I loved this game at the beggining. Butt at this point it's not fun at all. If I could give it 0 stars I would. You have to download everything all over again whith every update, the game is full of hackers and to top it all off, it's really buggy and laggy. I regret spending so much money on this game. Would not reccomend this game to anyone.",1
Can be hard can be normal. All depends on how good of a player you are. The game is the best shotting game üéÆ plus you can link up a controller to Bluetooth and play that way or you can just play on your phone with your fingers I love the BR matches open range board and it shrinks down to the best players and it gets ruthless,5
It's a very nice game. The graphics are amazing so far it is one of the best games that I have ever played in my whole life so I gave it 5 stars. According to me it is a very nice game and the controls are very good. So I suggest you to download this amazing game. When you try it out it will be so much fun. Also when i play it has so cool fps than i thought in the first it's like so cool game. This game has cool things and guns to abuse. Thank you for creating game like this i appreciate itüëç,5
I love the game but it should be more realistic like warzone with respect to things like - bullet drop - they should remove quick scoping in snipers to make the game more realistic -they should remove shoulder lighting of enemies in both br and mp matches......,5
Call of duty is the best gane on google play period hands down. They always have new maps new weapons its always uodated hands down better than anything on these cellphone games.,5
The it seems the more the update the game has started glitching and at some point it stops by its sef and goes to homepage mode it sucks,2
"Well it's a lot of to do... You can't choose the maps it's always random, then long term for loading updates amd a lot of more problems",2
"First time playing it giving it a four stars for now may upgrade later so far it seems interesting but two new to let you know, it is now March 2022 have enjoyed this game for a number of time now, but with the new season 3 game is getting very interesting so far a year and a half into it still enjoying it",4
"Kilo Bolt Action - Constable (Aiming Down Sites w/ No Scope) is STILL broken in BR, rear scope is out of position, making it near impossible to make a shot. The Luck Wheel is also STILL broken. Watching intell STILL doesent give lucky coupons. Most memorable map of any BR. Nostalgic Map Collection in Mulit-Player. Classic COD feel. Expected roster of weapons. Takes a back seat to PUB when it comes to BR but Best MP",4
"I still waiting more graphic customization and more sniper rifles but with a good design like m82 or idk, less meta abusing, there are more load time in the new season.",4
"Did this a year ago I was 11 years old and its truly good but some bugs may be witnessed. I played this first in when it came out probably on March, but I do remember that my first profile got removed because of password issues. So what I saying is play the game but dont mess up or you get mad.",4
The game is decent but it constantly crashes.every 2 games the game crashes and if I rejoin the match I get a bug that won't allow me to hit someone and it's very anoying.,3
Seems like the more they mess with this game the glitcher it becomes. Snipers seem to shoot around corners. Getting killed when the other guy hadn't started firing. Shoot people and it doesn't register as impacts. I could go on and on. I stop given this game money for all this.plus more. Need to find a better game to waste my time with,1
"The new update ruined my stats, the new update is full of lagging, timeouts, and the errors like ""your team is settled down"", what the hell is going on... I didn't understand??? I am at 150 level, having around 12 characters and lots of guns with max level, after investing that much time with passion, what I get is just, frustration... I loved the game for so many years, from playstation to Cod mobile, but know I am very much disappointed...",5
"Desynchronization + pay to win make me to play apex against CODM I'm playing since S1, but now I hate those things. Developers focus only about money, they didn't optimize this game. Really sad üòî Death of my favourite game",1
"devs destroyed this game lmfao edit: okay, the game is better rn, mx9 and holgae got nerfed, some bugs got deleted, new ranked system is also better than the old one. i hope new update wont destroy it again lmfao edit v2: damn, the game keeps getting even better with each season, i even can use guns that i like in ranked, which shows theres no broken weapons rn, thanks devs",5
This is one of the best FPS games out there but would love them to add slide and reload into the game because they have the ability to slide and reload would make it easier for other players because of when you slide and you tried to reload it just crushes and that's one of the functions that frustrates me the most !? @call of duty mobile,4
There's a very annoying bug since the last update that shuts all audio on the entire game when you play music from other apps. First I thought it must be something of my phone software but no it doesn't happen on other games or apps. And the biggest problem is when you're in the middle of a round and accidentally play some music and the entire game shuts all audio functions!,1
Been with since 2019 S1. Game has only gotten better! From graphics to customization! No major bugs if any. For best game experience and usage of all downloadable content I suggest playing from a higher end android or ios! And of course having a good source of Internet/WiFi connectivity! Ps. I don't think it's a pay to win game with a few exceptions! It really is all about having the features mentioned above and one's ability to play; which over time one can become a pretty decent player.,5
"This game was the best . You guys keep adding new classes and updates eating storage. Android users like me with 4GB ram used to enjoy high graphics, now I'm dealing with low graphics which really sucks. Take away ""Pumped"" and ""trapmaster"" classes. Bring back snowboards that move quick on land. Bring back more vehicles like helicopters into the Map. Make the settings easily available so 4GB ram devices can support high graphics like before. You can do itüëç",2
There is a major touch issue in season 5 scope didn't open properly I mean if you tap scope button it didn't work you have to tap 3/4 time to open scope please fixe this issue,2
"Add an emote bundle (pocket friendly) Add the possiblity to individually buy legendary or mythic guns (after the current season is over/or after it's crate release). Add a game mode where we can use all 10 attachments or 5 attachments without any negative attributes. Remove the negative points in clan wars in case of less active players. Add double XP card / double xp game mode for every kill whether gunfight, lethals, operator skill or score streaks.(currently it's limited to weapon kills)",4
The game is very good. I've been playing it since the release but it keeps on crashing and my phone is not hot. And we need zombies üò©,5
"This games i really fun and i enjoy it, but there is only one problem. So in the daily login rewards, im now supposed to get the Special ops 5, but when i click claim nothing happens It also says i have claimed an emote and a red back 0ack, but its not in my inventory. Please help",3
I'm long time player of all call of duty games from Playstation to mobile I never seen so many players glitch in a game before until now. If you fix all the glitch then this game could get 5 stars but until that happens you just get 1 star. Why can't you fix all the glitch in the game.,1
Great game. honestly pleaseeeee just leave alcatraz on it full time I love the game mode and regular br just isn't as fun to me tank battle is okay and so are all the other ones but alcatraz is where the fun is and the map is better put together in my opinion,4
"Always giving the TIMEOUT ERROR on startup, support staff recommend reinstalling the game but don't consider that the game requires redownloading resources of 12 GB whether you reinstall or update the app. And it takes a whole night to reinstall or update the app & download all resources before playing a match in the game.",2
"It's a good game through. But some problems are much annoying. Such as auto-downloading resource, slow loading & matchmaking, connection problems, auto-graphics set and can't change or modify these settings too. Again my question is, Why the hell the game downloads extra 300/700mb file even after downloading 2.2gb from play store. I mean everything should be packed up in that size right? Also the game takes up about 3-5 gb storage space together. Fix these kindly!",3
There is a glitch Sometimesthe player doesn't shoot even when pressing the fire button and the bullet doesn't damage even when you are connecting. Network and all are good though,3
Hi In most of the phones receiving android 12 version and after updating the game is lagging even with full speed of good internet connection. Kindly check the bug and fix it team.,2
I love this game so much üíñbut something happened to me I purchased the fourth season with ground forses but something happened that I found out that there are some players who took this season for free and I am very upset because I am a fan of Call of Duty Mobile and more than that I have downloaded the game since it was announced and sad that I paid a large amount and other players took it Free,5
"Played 2 years straight for atleast 6 hours a day. Updated my phone and my account was lost with no help from Activision, I have never played since. Has been 5 months now and I won't restart with new account again. Went back to PUBG at the moment until sorted.",1
"Call of duty is literally the best warfare game that i have ever played and trust me , it's worth the space . I love the graphics and how you get to customize and upgrade your equipment . One thing tho , i think there needs to be more maps added with bigger areas/spaces to move about but other than that , everything's great!",5
It's sloppy often the fire button doesn't work how your supposed to look an fire is beyond me and the easy setting just wastes ammo like I said it's sloppy,1
"I'm changing my review to 2 stars. Last couple of weeks experiences are just the worst. The server issues I am facing cannot be tolerable anymore. Everything works fine in the lobby, but once I enter the game, it doesn't load any other characters. The game just puts me in the middle of nowhere or sometimes up in the air then it's like I am running on an invisible treadmill. I cannot believe that I am starting to hate this game for the experience it's giving me. I really loved this game.",2
"Still a fun way to kill time, but the franchise has fallen a few notches. The influence of the operator skills on gameplay should be reserved for mid to upper level scorestreaks, with the fruity fantasy weapons eliminated altogether. More control should be afforded to the users as to who they're matched with, particularly by connection speed and geographical distance. The profanity ban needs to be lifted, or user settings created along with seperate lobbies for people with tender ears.",3
"The organizers of this game sacrifice you if you play for free to each player subscribed to their package.. Warning, this game is not free.. If you play for free, you will become an easy prey for each subscriber, even if your experiences and levels match them.",1
Yall really need to stop with all the taking more space for every update. Its ridiculous how much space this takes in your phone and every time they do an update there they go again taking up more space. Pretty much dont play unless you have a gaming phone on the side.,2
"I would like to give five Star but I see that this app would necessary a strong internet connection to be used, i think that is the default, this my point of view. And also I would have liked it to have a change in the weather for each of the Map, that is to say a sunny, rainy, snowy weather for example. This will make the game more realistic in order to promote a good immersion in the game.",3
I really like the game and all the guns seem pretty Balanced based on real life the only thing I would say they can do better is sometimes lag and I wish we could shoot while in cover (peaking) but for a Mobil game it is pretty good and I recommend it. Hope this helps!,5
ENOUGH WITH THE STUPID UPDATES THAT CHANGE COSTUMES! All it does is slow the game down the players gain nothing who cares if theres a new robocop avatar or something stupid like that if it ain't broke dont fix it people it shouldn't take 5 minutes to load the game this isn't a ps5,3
"You know this game is pretty nice. It has all the content from other COD titles (ex. gun skins, characters and character skins, maps etc.). It used to be very fun to play this game, but now IDK why but I lost my interest in it. I just can't seem to like it anymore. It doesn't make any sense, one day I was addicted to it and then the other I coudn't even play 2 matches other than me forcing myself to play it. It isn't only me; a lot of my friends also pointed this out and YouTubers too.",5
"Fun when I can play it. But it requires so many downloads anymore. And now it won't download the resources. It just freezes and says ""calculating resources to delete""",1
When ever i get into the game there is always some screwed update and my 2 of the email ids are blocked you have very shity team of beggers please make it clear that is this game can be played in emulators yes or no... if yes then which one if no then OK,1
crashes fix it or I'm deleting. Every time it crashes it counts as a loss stat. Never had a problem until the update.,1
"I don't know if any one else is having trouble with this, but y'all need to fix it to where the app doesn't randomly kick you out at any time.. I'm getting tired of it and it makes to where I can't even play. Please fix this ASAP!!!!!",5
This game is awesome and it has good graphics and its good to play with friends but some guns dont have alot of ammo but its still great wish they made a games like this all the time but sometimes it lags when i shoot someone it shoots but that person dies after a few seconds but i just cant wait to play in new seasons and new modes of br,4
"It's a great game and the graphics are great. I would give it a 5* except the devs are way too focused on P2W which means the matchmaking totally sucks. When using cell service glitches at the wrong times, causes battery to overheat and then crashes cell service.",1
"Amazing game and graphics, but honestly, if the ""data"" gets any bigger I'll have to quit playing, this game takes up more than half of one of my ipads, so I'll most likely uninstall. I'll keep it on my phone though. I do love playing with friends.",4
"This game will forever be a classic. The graphics are exceptional and the gameplay is smooth. However, the developers need to work on making the game updates less frequent for a better user experience.",3
"Everything is good in this game, 99% perfect, except the lag, iam using a device with 4gb ram 8 core 2ghz processor device ofc it's a low end device but the lags and stutter i face is high. I face heavy lag while engaging with enemy. Codm plz optimize the game as far as you guys can. If u do that my rating will be 5 star.",4
"This game is a great pass time at work and it itches my need to play zombies until i get a new xbox. However one thing i don't like is the controller option. The only way to use one is through wireless xbox or ps controller. Which is fine. But something like the razer kishi (or any other ""plug in"" conttoller) which is physically connected to my phone isn't compatible. Personally that doesn't make sense and hopefully the developers will consider letting us use controllers plug into your phone!",4
This is one of the best Mobile shooter games on the market not only does it have lots of players but it is available on both android and ios. The only downfall is its storage but with the content graphics and playstyle it is the perfect game for mobile fps. Other than Garena Free fire and PUBG mobile this has more updates and better gameplay this should be a more fun experience plus all of the creators has some surprises coming soon. Since this app did so well they are releasing Warzone Mobile.,5
"This update, I don't know why it is just not letting me enter the game it is always loading with the caption ""checking version info"" And nothing happens it is just struck there forever if any of the game dev is seeing this please fix the problem I would like to play the game again",1
"The game takes A LOT of storage, and it lags TOO MUCH, but those are the only things. Besides that, I love it üòã I recommend it if u have extra storage.",4
"The game is fun but lots of us miss the classic zombies, and a campaign would be awesome. The game would be ALOT better.",1
"Worst experience now I'm not able to even open the game, even my internet is at good speed. It's showing again and again same error for past 3 days.",1
"I absolutely love this game. When I have free time, I play it right away. However, I've seen some players float. They literally jump and jump again; it makes it look like their flying. I'm not sure if it's hackers or a glitch in the game. I still enjoy playing the game even though I keep having many losses :')",3
Best game to connect and play with friends and this game is better than free fire üî•. But wish It uses mb instead of gb because it is taking too much of storage in my phone .,4
This game requires you update and redownload so dang often. It happens probably every other week. Alot of phones can't handle the amount of space it needs to keep up with all the updates.,3
"Ranked matches it matters about ping only if a guy is getting a first shot on a low pinger still the low pinger will win. And codm is there a new feature called first kill wins??Like wth r u doing bruh, u mean in a hardpoint match our score will literally just stay stuck on 15 and the opponent's team is skyrocketing to 150. In the end if u total the enemy's kills and urs u can just find the huge difference. Could u please whts all this codm. I don't hate the game but ur making me dislike it üòî.",1
Season 2 update thinks my Xbox controller is p/s and the scores aren't adding up correctly. Game is great though keep up the great work,5
"This game is not made for low end devices. To play this game, u need at most 6GB RAM to have fun otherwise lags, overheating etc... and a lot of storage. And you know the reasoning. Daily update, season change updates etc. I'm not saying it's a bad game..it's a very good game I like it very much but the only problem is that it's not for low end devices. That's the saddest part I feel. I hope CoDM community can fix this problem.",4
"Authorisation error, goes to some random screen that is only accessible via WiFi even when you've got screaming 5G... Bloody frustrating ‚òπÔ∏è",1
"Ok to waste time but don't waste money. Paid gold weapons are op. Why can't i remove the notifications in br, i don't care who killed who especially if it's right in the middle of my screen and in the way(laughably bad design).",1
I have a top rating and recently it has gotten to where I can shoot players tens of times without killing them and I am killed with 2shots...there are obviously people cheating and they do not monitor it!!!,2
"Great game.. but last update has made it really easy and im getting close to uninstalling due to boredom. Every match i get into, ranked or not, is filled with bots! Feels like the same match over and over and over again.",4
"Fully supported the game, until I lost rank after the games updated, went from master to elite after earning the rank of master. Kinda pissed about tried contact through game with no luck, prompts that don't answer anything. I really want rank back but of course they'll make me earn it again, changing 5 stars to 1",1
Actually fun for the most part. Lots of bots tho? It's weird. Works with Xbox controllers but not things like razer kishi. The lack of controller support is the big downside. I just got this to repurpose my old phone and COD is a big L. Please fix this.,2
"BR BLACKOUT is the absolute best. I do have a major bug bear that has not been resolved. I lost my Original profile, moving to a new device and have not been able to get it back, even though I followed the precise steps to link my game to my blizzard account. I have since lost all avatars, weapons, etc including alot of money on in-game purchases. I followed all the help suggestions to restore my original profile, with Zero luck, Please help!",5
"Very good game, but there's a problem. It's too lagy sometimes, I think intead of getting new stuff out, y'all should optimize your game. Cheers!",3
"The latest update is not able to authenticate my account through Facebook. Deleted the update and retried it, still the same problem.",1
"Love this game. But scoring system is bad. 1) In domination, the player should be pointed on the basis of how much he/she holds the point. Yet the MVP goes to people who are making kills like it's a TDM. 2)Even in TDM where we win because of kills, yet the MvP goes to the player with most 'normal kills'.......I mean I just scored 70 people(kills) and the guy with the 36 kills gets the MvP? Thanks for removing S&D from ranked matches, though!üôåüèª",4
I changed my 5 star rating from 2020 to 3 star now. These updates and downloads are getting ridiculous! In the past 5 days I've had to download updates every day. Figure it out before you send out the updates!,3
It's been almost a year and I haven't been able to play at all. Screen keeps saying loading timeout and I'm stuck at 10ms ping. There has been no help at all with this issue.,1
"Extraordinary, game resembles system games like a mirror. I dont really do missions i just try to destroy, enemies. Lol highly recommend üëå üëè thanks for your time.",4
"The game itself it great, but I got a issue. I downloaded the HD resource package and restarted the game only to find that there was no options to change the graphics in game.",5
"Fun, but if you care about cosmetics you'll end up spending quite a bit. I myself just buy season passes, as everything else is kind of overpriced.",4
Great game but I think it's unfair that those who can't afford the battle passes still lose out on great in game merch I been playing for a while an in my opinion i think there should be more or better ways to be able to get stuff in game,5
"Seriously, fix whatever algorithm that generates the map choice! I have to download gigabytes of data to play the same maps repeatedly!!! BORING",1
"I don't know why the game isn't starting üòï after the Update,I've even reinstalled it and I think Call of duty should fix this bug.",1
Good game and no problems updates coming every month is just crazy and skins and controls are awesome.also is very competitive but the reason I took one star was because you need a good device or your game will lag.,4
"When I play battle royale mode the screen goes black in middle of the game. I'm using a device with Snapdragon 732G chipset, 6GB RAM and 128 Storage. The black screen issue is so annoying otherwise the game is really awesome EDIT: The screen blackout issue was resolved after the update for the next season. The game is stable now",5
"Damn the Devs have made the game so smooth (compared to S8 '21). Also, the graphics are crisper and beautiful (for br) and absolutely no desync issues. Works perfectly fine On a 4gb or 8gb ram device on low graphics. Tbh, the game is trying to get itself and the players back on the board. Should definitely Reinstall if you have removed it from your mobile.",5
"The best ever game, graphics quality, user interface, audio, weapons are just awesome .. It is definitely preferred over PubG",5
I've been banned twice for hacking. I have never hacked. They can't even tell me why I was banned. Just a rigorous process that they have no idea what it is. They sent a link telling me to read it. I read it and I did nothing of the sort. Really disappointed. I would rate zero if I could. Don't waste your time or money cause you could lose it all.,1
"It's a very nice and challenging game, representing the franchise. But I strongly recommend a solution for the Ping problem in many african countries, many (if not all) african players have a very bad experience in online gaming, specially in shooting games. I think solving this problem would increase exponentially the gaming community in these countries, because it would atract many gamers that are very good but doesn't play online games due to the high ping that they have in their countries.",4
Uninstalled it but redownload it. Because of the glitches but for some reason. I found out my internet wasn't connecting because of the tower connection. I have to leave a comment on the subject. Because I saw multiple comments about glitching. I redownload it after my internet was fixed. To my surprise it wasn't bad at all. I was so aggravated to because I have spent so much of my time and money. Just happy nothing was lost in the process! They got me back ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,5
After recent updates they made it worse. Very uncomfortable gameplay. I dont understand but it's not like i use to play before.,1
"Since the new season 10 has started, my game is starting to get very slow. When i press any option it just says waiting for a long time and then it says connecting to server. It happens every time. Moreover, when i press the start/ready button it starts/ready after a long delay and waiting. Please fix this issue codm. I like this game but this really annoys me. I might actually delete the game after this.",3
"I used to login through my facebook but now I cannot login to my account. It shows some authentication error, please fix.",1
"great game, everything about it is just absolutely awesome, too good to be a mobile game it's just like the playstation one, the graphics and everything, no ads, this game is pure perfection, i love it!!!",5
"I used to love this game so much. Then they started randomly banning people! I didn't even get the initial 12 hour ban, mine went straight to 24! When I looked online everywhere people are say it was happening to them too! 12 hours, 24 hours... THEN 10 YEARS!!! I haven't played since my ban because I don't want to lose all of my hard work. I contacted Activision and they still haven't gotten back to me!",1
Awesome game play. Cant wait for story mode or 1v1 or 2v2. Wish you had some way to a pic other then the avatars through something else besides Facebook.,5
"Lag is unbearable, I can't even land in game. And if I by some miracle do the screen freezes whenever someone comes up. Terrible game.",1
This is exactly what I needed. I've been looking far a cod game for years that doesn't need a console and this is it. I recommend that new players stick to a single weapon and get good at that wepon.,5
"The game has started glitching in BR over the last couple weeks. I've never had this issue before. But since it has started, my game will randomly freeze up in the middle of BR and I have no other option but to close out of the game and reload it. More times than not, I have already been found and shot by the time I get loaded back in. This has happened at least 6-10 times over the last couple weeks. Very frustrating and needs to be fixed.",5
It was a great game till all these azzholes started cheating. Play for yourself and see characters running fast and guns with endless ammo. It's a shame cause it was good.,1
Best fps on mobile ever!!! Besides the fact it keeps deleting my login info I had to reset my password for my cod account multiple times and it's not a quick fix why give the option to remember my account if it won't starting to dislike how the system is being handled,4
"Rip offs. Put you in a championship then have you start three of your matches in games already started and your team losing. So they automatically count as losses. Of course try contacting them about this and you are flat out ignored. Great customer service, and I pay every season, to be cheated.",2
It's a very nice game but it needs a little improvement in battle royal and weapons otherwise the game is not amazing.,5
The new update has made it impossible for me to login with my Facebook I have been trying for the past 5 days and just can't I've never had this problem with the older versions. Please fix this,2
"Best improving br mobile game (I wish their was better config for low devices tho cuase it crashes at the worst moments ) and is it so much to ask for one mythic weapon that im trying to buy the crates gave me everything but the gun""lucky draw isnt lucky at all it needs to be random and not make the mythic weapon the last thing you get in a crate (its a scam)",4
"It's aight. I wish there was let's bots on your team in multi-player modes. Theres plenty of time where the aimlessly pacing bots take absolutely forever to find eachother on the maps when it comes down to bot vs bot on both teams. And for some reason it seems like when it comes to shooting me, bots have perfect aim, but while watching them while waiting for the next round, they absolutely never fire their weapon. How does that happen?",3
Your game is good but it sucks here's why ..your game isn't optimized it laggs alot...to much how can I land in rivertown with other players and the houses aren't even loaded yet....tf it doesn't even make sense I'll pick up a gun but Itll take forever before the gun is even ready to use and I can't even see skins again only special op1 it's disgusting like tf optimize your game and fix lags tf this game has potential but your not doing your jobüòê optimize the game and make it better this is BS,1
"Very realistic, where humans with blades are bullet proof and can run faster than humans, dogs are also bullet proof and kill with one bite from 10ft away, long barrel sniper rifles are faster to weild than pistols.... It goes on. Also, once a team gets an advantage the other team's reaction time is slown down so the winning team appears they can kill with one look and are also almost bullet proof. Apart from this 'realism' it's a good game.",3
"Been playing for years as GoldenArmz47, have over 70k kills and now since the update the game is just garbage now, instead of level 150 I'll be level 2 with the name gamesucksnow...why are there 1000 different skins for weapons?",1
Am very happy and excited on the new update . I rate you 10 But it will be more fun and playable when player battle at night ü§î And shouldn't their be raining weather because I haven't seen it since am playing the game Please do something about it,5
"The game used to be best like the best, untill the updates. The updates made the game worse. Trap master is now a useless class and other issues like that",3
this new update has gone very glitchy every 10 sec it keeps wanting to change gun if you are over someone's gun which has been dropped by a killed soldier.,2
Since the update it will load the game but then get stuck on the screen that comes before selecting the games modes that are available to play,2
"Ever since the new update It keeps telling me time out an reloads over an over I have to keep trying a few good times just to play a game that glitches , as well as everytime there's a 12mb update or some update you have to keep doing.",1
"Gave it 1 star because there's no 0, The game is buggy even with a good connection, lag is inevitable when playing with these so called ""pros"" your bullets just fly through them and the hit won't be recorded, their ""advanced movement"" cause a lot of lag in your side, Only powerful guns are guns with Pay to use attachments and skins, Uninstalling till they fix this pay to win game, if you want a good mobile game that isn't pay to win I recommend PUBGM and NEWSTATE mobile",1
"Best of this genre on mobile, particularly the large team multiplayer options. Also the best value for money game I've played in a decade. Small real money investment brings in new rewards each season with only moderate game time- awesome. Suggestion: some AI levels or daily challenges such as survival or kills with limited ammo for bonuses.",5
Glitches another an drops you in a random multi-player match where the other team is winning buy a lot an have to try to play catch up to win. An freezes all the time,3
Since the update i can't login to my account through facebook. It keeps giving me a whole new account. 4yrs playing this game. Im lvl 150 and now all progress is lost. If support can't recover my account. Im done with this game.,1
Please I am a Nigerian üá≥üá¨ the game is. So nice I love it as well but I feel you all should key in a play to earn feature on the game to let us earn while we play the game in our region as well. Because in other continents people play games and earn but over here we haven't had any game with such feature... Please just look into it,5
"honestly this is great fun to have with a friend or a partner. but it does get very normal cod style boring once you play alone but either way its awesome game to play, also i had a problem connecting my controller to the game when i played? could u help sort this out please",4
"This used to be my favorite game until a weird glitch occurred. This glitch made the game unplayable, because it wouldn't let me turn the screen. (This happens several times, especially during ranked matches) My ping ranges from 28-80ms at most. My phone has 8 GB of RAM, and a 64-bit processor. My friend also had this same problem, and he has the Samsung Galaxy S9. Please help me üò≠",1
"New update is being so difficult n complicated, the old one is better thn ever, obviously graphics are great but that bug and glitches are increasing, so makes some solution",3
How am i supposed to complete the ibjectives for ranked mat mulitplayer if it never puts me in a mp match on ranked mode. And im starting to notice a bunch of the same cheats from the game systems happen on the mobile version fix it! Immediately!,1
Its a good game but this game has way to much updates and it kills my phone battery way to fast and it takes up alot of space on my phone and I haven't played the game In a while but when I go to play to see how the game Is it logs me out of my account and i can't get back in and I have been playing for years i was over rank 150 and it dont let me log back in dont recommend this game because it logs you out,1
"Good game but doesnt work with wifi for some reason, only mobile data works while playing the game, any suggestions on how to fix this issue?",3

I have yet to download game. But had previous file but somehow COD app deleted and now am waiting to see if the account on which I played may still be there upon signing in or would I have to start all over again? I don't even know if I'll receive an answer here or not. But all in all it is the greatest game I have played on a mobile device. If there were more than 5 stars to rate. I would put 40. Thank you COD Mobile!!!,5
I have just 5 days of players the game and I 100% love it....it has a lot of changes...but this morning it has just stopped working what cold be the problem someone help,4
"App has gotten better, however when spending money to buy characters, we should be able to get exactly what we want to buy. I get you guys are in it to make money off the drawing, but spending 300 cp on a bs shield or floating image that I could care less about is unimpressive. Atleast put the new feature in a crate and just charge for everything. The random draws are annoying.",3
Good game but failed to update so many time on celluler data. It took more time and data to update when 100% downloading completed.,3
Why can't i be assigned to a team in battle royale ? I did everything you should when it comes to selecting the proper mode and preferences.... Help,4
"Game play is good, if you wanted to purchase draws for mythic guns think it ends up been around ¬£130 which is a joke. Apart from that good game",4
losing appreciation for this game can clearly see hackers lag switching the game when they dont get the win holding u on screen tell there points ahead fix all these games wont be worth playing soon if dont solve problem,1
Amazing game I luv the graphics and guns. This isn't better than black ops 3 but overall a great CoD. I'd appreciate if they would add back the old zombies mode because the new one kind of sucks. Season 2 wasn't that great but they added amazing weapons and a good battle pass. Thank you for a good CoD I'd definitely try this if you don't have access to black ops.,5
Bad. Every match i play i get 200ms for no reason and i end up dying and dying over and over again. I'm done with this game until yall fix this.,1
Please switch Lerch's voice to something more.. suitable to his character it's somewhat a shame he sounds nothing like he looks. Amazing game anyway üí™,5

it has become almost impossible to play for a thumb player like me. out of 20 matches i won only 3 or 4. It's not the game fault but i think snipers shouldn't be allowed with AR players.. And Nowdays players are camping also.. Had to un-install..,5
Love your game very much but you see there might be a glitch because i unlocked the melee item from the event but it didnt give it to me i cant find it anywhere,5
Worked for like 2 days. Then the Catpcha wouldn't load. Or it timed-out. Even with wifi. The mobile game is not worth the hassle.,1
"I absolutely love this game I've played it since the beginning when it came onto PlayStore. Gameplay: I'm quite satisfied with the frame rate on the game about 57fps the quality is unbelievable it's super extravagant and the maps have to be downloaded,but I don't really have a problem with that,the smoothness,the texture quality is overall good but yea that's it. I recommend this game for everyone to play but further on it is a 9/10 game I'd say well done to the developers and programmers.",5
"Awesome thank you so much for the great quality and experience with this game,I am back 2yrs later to say the game has went down hill,it keeps telling me to make sure it's online and that the download configuration is not working,I used to enjoy it but every time it's been updated it's gotten worse.ive had to uninstall and reinstall it so many times it's anoying. Fix the game.",2
"3/16/22, this game is really good, entertaining and addictive. The problem is it crashes a lot, it's unplayable. If it didn't crash, I'd rate 5 star, unfortunately, I'm rating 1 (because I can't rate 0) star and uninstalling in two days if it's not fixed. By the way, my internet connection is perfect and many others have reviewed the same, so don't tell me to check my internet. A game too big and doesn't work, what a shame!",1
"I love it, it is all around good, but my one complaint is the constant loading and the app size, it eats up a ton of storage space and takes a very long time to load, but overall, it's a fun game. The one problem with gameplay is that ranked matches are broken, it is impossible to win, that puts a blow on the stars.",3
"With the January 2022 update, Activision have again buried their head in the sand and many of the same problems are still slapping players in the face. Lazy and poor programing, invisible enemies and vehicles, the sound cuts out randomly, and the new blackout map is dull. Features such as being able to climbing trees and objects has been removed. To make thing worse it seems to be behaving more and more like a pay to win game as 'bought' weapons seem ridiculously powerful. Shame on you.",1
"I love it, I'm ex military and I have done well on the game in my eyes, I get a lot of MVP, also nice comments of people! Look at my credentials and see, my second time on this and I got to level 126 b4 my phone broke so I started the game again but I only got to level 65 or something I haven't played it for a long time going to get back into it and it's 9 master I'm an AK-47 mash them I'm quite a lot of masters on the guns you know I've got a good player so I can't wait to get back into it is",5
I was extremely happy in the start of the game . I used a guest account and was stacked until today when it made me make a account and I lost all progress I am furious at the creators. Ativevision if u read this fix your game,2
"Okay, so I gave it 5 stars but there's one problem that's annoying me quite much, in ranked games sometimes, some players decide to go afk, and in final round they decide to come back and do one kill, it's not alright because one player can be game changer, it would be nice to add some afk detection system. Besides that, all good, enjoying it .",5
"Best first person shooter game for mobile. It has everything that a typical gamer would want: guns, online matchmaking and cosmetics. Sure it might be a money grab, but it has some really awesome features and has proved that with by giving free blueprints and other such cosmetics which can influence the game slightly for free. Really well made, with minor bugs but those can easily be dealt with.",5
"Excellent gameplay. Great graphics and controls. . You don't have to spend a penny to compete like other games. Always getting updates with plenty of new characters, maps, guns and plenty more. I highly recommend this game. A must play.",5
"Seriously the team in charge isn't helping anymore.. my game has become unbearably bad. At the rate at which this game is going , people will leave cod for good",1
"A very fun game. You dont have to download everything all at once, but then you only have a couple maps and weapon skins. They want a LOT of storage for stuff. The download isnt big at first, but things add up, it gets to be really big. Im sure its over 5GB by now. Other than the growing file size, this game it great. Feels fair in the amount of stuff you get and unlock. Although, it would be nice if they gave a little more cosmetics for free. Good game, well done with good graphics.",4
Game became trash now. Waiting to be put into a game and it sends me back to home page and then restarts the counter... super buggy,1
"The gave is super nice, been playing for long time now and it still keeping me entertained. Great graphics and runs smooth",5
"Game is good, graphics are good, concept is good. But what is the point of all this if game will keep crashing all the time. My game keep crashing in battle royale. Not even single match i was able to play without a crash. No use of all these pros if you can't play full match.",3
"Definitely one of the best mobile games I've ever played. Highly enjoyable. Battle pass is worth looking into - which is saying a lot, as I am usually disapointed by in-app purchases. Basic battle pass pays for itself if you are playing enough. It is a decent port from console to phone and I have yet to grow bored.",5
Activision has created the best mobile shooter out right now and I'd like to commend them on that but the state of playing the game and the experience is kinda disappointing. There's guns that have dominated the mp ranked scene and are making to game unbearable to a certain extent. I would like for those weapons to be altered and made more balanced. And paid item are way to expensive. Other than that we'll done Activision.,4
Honestly the ppl doigntbhe update a are kinda ruining the game they took out the zombies game mode a long time ago it was one 9fy favorite things to do. And the game takes up so much space now I remember when it was only like 1 or 2 gigs also a request can you guys maybe add a sort of performance mode to lower the graphics even more if I get that I'll change to 5 stars,2
"The problem is it's a take forever to download maps and other things after every update and it takes forever to download those resources and maps. Please either fix this issue or make all updates and downloads to be done in background, outside the app and while playing a match.",2
"Fast & fun....I play this on my Samsung S6 tablet & it works just fine. Only issue have found is that I get very jittery game play, or when loading, not everything loads, when my vpn is turned on. I turn it off, & everything is fine. There some glitches, I suppose that's to be expected of a game this size.....could do with being able to throw grenades & the like, a bit quicker",5
Top shelf for me gameplay wise. Love it. Only thing I can grumble with is the lag sometimes. When I have perfect signal and I only I have well enough data or WiFi. Still lags here n there. A little bit annoying when under fire. Other than that. The creaters have done an excellent job.,5
Overall game is pretty good compared to other battle royale and shooter games. I love sniping but the snipers are lind of bad with slow ads speed and huge flinch. If you van master the guns your unstoppable. Some guns need balance changes. And it is recommended that you have a stable wifi connection. And most MP matches are filled with bots or pros rarely in between.,5
"I love this game, but it gets so annoying in BR, each time I use the ADS there's a pink square covering my screen which makes it hard to shoot at someone in front of you... Please fix this ASAP .... I'm not the only one with this problem... You can look it up on YouTube Edit 1: this was fixed so I'm giving it a 5*",5
"Very much a call of duty money grab. The outfits freely available look cheap and lazy, and yet there's such a variety if you're willing to part with your real life money. Having said that, can still be great fun despite your appearance. However, the BR games have been incredibly laggy as of late and make it almost unplayable. Multiplayer has been fine which means it's definitely their BR servers.",4
Love this game. But some times controls freezes and sometime there are glitches in the game example sometimes you just fell out of the world map in classic and there are many hackers in the game like yesterday when I was playing multiplayer someone killed me but was invisible I was not able to see how as same for my teammates so please improve you security system thanks,5
Very nice and accommodating to many different game modes. I'm not a huge gamer but this definitely caught my attention. I've been searching for some others like this high quality for the phone to play other shooting games but none are a quarter as good. Crazy that it's free. Great job and really enjoy the product.,5
"I played with my controller for some time, but then suddenly after an update it didn't work anymore. My controller connects but it does not recognise the inputs that I'm giving, some inputs even changed. I've contacted support but it has been like 3months and still nothing. I've messaged everyday for 2weeks and still nothing. Game has not been the same ever since.",1
"You seriously need to fix the delays when shooting,running, jumping ect and the odd glitching. I watched many kill Cams where It showed me standing still when in fact I was running when killed. I'm all for a competitive game, but the fact many players feel their are hackers/cheaters makes this game less desirable. Either fix the issues or lose many players...I used to love this game. Now it makes more stress than it releases...",1
Love it. I only play BR mode!! Amazing game. Use a good device and this game works very well. I've noticed that there very is a slight lag for a second when someone else appears somewhere around you on the map when roaming around in BR. And this game can drain battery. About 10% per game. But I love the game. Play almost every day,5
"Codm is by far the best mobile game out right now, but it's not the same feel as it had in 2019. In 2019 it was perfect, it felt good...now people get bored halfway through the season, we get gun skins in the battle pass for guns we have skins for from the previous season, crates are so repetitive, daily crates are just things that we all got for free a year ago, what about us that already has those? It's also extremely large, with little improvements every season, beautiful game could be better",3
"The game itself is great, but there are two major problems.. 1: no prestige system & 2: clan renaming bug. The lack of a prestige system is a big deal when ranking up is literally as easy as playing matches. I've been level 150 since about three months into season one. I have been stuck at 150 for nearly 24 months.",1
"Game is super awesome now, it was super glitchy, but with some more updates it got a bit better, kinda wish zombies was there tho. Edit: zombies is in the game now, it's not that bad but it's hard, one more thing this game needs is Android controller support honestly, since I have a razer kishi and can't properly play games with it, if y'all do add support for it, I promise I'll buy stuff from the store, cuz I love the game a lot and all the cosmetics you all add!!",5
"It requires more graphical power compared to when it first came out. Can we bring it down a notch. Like each season the graphics just go over and extreme. Overall pretty cool, I used to carry my laptop around to play cod when I was in college. Now I can just have my phone.",5
It's a very addictive game i must say. But lately i haven't been satisfied by how the graphics requirements have been increased. I used to play on medium and low graphics and it was possible for me to view orher players skins now my game is limited to low graphics quality only and I can't differentiate bot from a real player since the skins are all the same even when I've downloaded everything in the game. I know you won't even review this so I'll just keep this post here until it is noticed. üôÑ,2
It is one of the best game that I have ever played. The controls are easy and also it provides many characters and gun skins for free which is really awsome. The only problem is it consumes so much space in our phones except that the game is cool.,5
"Great game but not the best, I'm a huge fan of it, I'd wish for more weapons and optimizations, and I'd wish a mode where I can earn free or reward based CP by events, and please bring back a lot of skins, make it available again, like the reaper robot, which is my favorite but also eliminate bugs and problems so that it can maintained well",5
"I have always loved call of duty so this is a definite yes for me, and the controls and range of weapons is exemplary in my opinion. The updates do take quite a bit of storage space though, almost a GB every update. I'm up to 14 GB for the entire app.",5
"Great game, best mobile shooter besides PUBG. I give it five stars for gameplay and experience. Reason it gets two stars is simply because the amount of space it takes up. Every new update seems to need another 2-3 GB of data to update it. And that's including the over 10 GB you've downloaded already. I know you can delete things but the game plays best when everything is downloaded. Even on a 64GB phone having this game take over 10GB of data is very annoying.",2
"Everytime I open it gets crashed! I'm using Motorola g40 fusion, and it's unplayable in my device, simple solutions like clearing cache, app data or uninstall-reinstall nothing worked. Please help. After 6 months of writing previous comment, now in mid 22 everything working fine. But won't change the review because of all this days, that you haven't cared for.",1
"Love the game, play it all the time. Great graphics and controls. But the prices on crates and featured things are a little too high. $130 just to get a legendary gun. The high prices is why it's not 5 stars. Other than that. Love it",4
"This game is being neglected. Instead of pay items, why don't they release more br maps? There are so many mp maps, there is zero need for more. There is a zombie mode that can be given a story side just to make it more interesting. Apex is starting to look more appealing by the second.",2
This game used to be amazing ...it used to be so smooth but since the last update it has been extremely laggy ...I'm very disappointed to what they have done to the game and when I change the quality settings to the lowest it lags even more .... This seriously needs to be sorted out otherwise there's no sense in playing the game ...it's very disappointing...but on the bright side they have added some nice new features but that won't matter if it continues to laaaaaaaaggggggg,1
"Pretty awesome, its like a blend of modern warfare and black ops. There are a few differances. I dont like the fact that in free for all, theres not a way to talk to the oppsoing players like you can in modern warfare, but other than that, pretty great game. Especially with my ps4 being down, i like to continue the gameplay...not gonna lie, very addictive gameüòÅ",5
Been playing since launch. Game is good although tougher to max rank th3se days due to increase in the required points. Also more difficult being a thumbs player vs trigger players. But still good crack. Games class even though the stability isn't always correct in game (occasional lag spike entering a fight in br or mp) some players seem godlike but I still love a good challenge and that's what the game still delivers.,5
Game works fine until a call comes in or any other notification on the phone. I have a QGeeM dongle and a PS4 controller hooked up. As soon as the phone rings or certain notifications you lose all control of the controller. Would rate 5 stars but this is a big inconvenience. When it is fixed I'll change my review. It seems several people have complained about this issue.,4
Absolutely love the game just wish they had an option to get an account back if you lose your Facebook and it's linked. Spent quite a bit of money and lost all of it so make sure you make an actually cod account. And it delays here and there but most mobile games do!,5
I love this game and have no problem with it but my only issue is with so many updates and their memory size. I have very little memory left on my phone and can only download a few maps. It limits my play experience. Is there anyway that you can cut back on so many updates or make them smaller. Thank you.,4
The game itself is pretty awsome but The amount of cheating and hackers that they allow is ridiculous! You expect a few to get through but you cant play a game most days without being overrun with it. Essentially you get penalized in gameplay because you lost to someone that cant be killed. You get penalized if you lose cell coverage as well. As of 1/1/22 its getting a little better on weeding out cheaters. Thanks guys,3
"I never played the pc version but the mobile version really makes me stick to the game daily. The graphics are the best, the gun customisation is great, I wonder when will the zombie mode come back as there is still the trophy or achievement system available for that",3
"Edit: Now Network issue is fixed! Whenever i play, it says Connect to internet 428 Error. But in other games my game runs perfectly. I also Allowed CODM to access my internet Connection or wifi connection but there's a problem I'm facing! Kindly Fix This! Thank You! Edit 2 Now it's Improved Far than before! But sometimes It Automatically Stops! Only Some Times. BEST FPS (Fpp Mode) GAME.",4
"They never fix stuff. This game has gotten so bad. Please fix all the lag and the garbage meta. Br is almost un-playable for everyone because of lag, frame drops and 4 second freezing and crashing. New season, and you still didn't fix things. Million dollar company can't fix stuff?greedy company.",3
"Greate game, awesome upgrades and attention to detail. Just a bit bad when it comes to gameplay sometimes. The ping drops like crazy, even with my 5G 50mbs fibre wifi. And the frame rate drops aswell when the ping drops. But other than that, I atleast enjoy 8 out of 10 games",4
"Game play is perfect! Multi player, battle royale, daily goals, awesome. BUT the zombies mode could definitely go back to the classic style. I'd much rather have the 'just kill zombies, without all the BS' way. Great game tho other than that",4
Before most recent update would of been 5 star. But players turning invisible mid gunfight. Gun will just dissappear off the screen mid gunfight and stop shooting. And then will reappear. So buggy atm was running really well until latest update. Edit: Problem has been resolved game runs smooth enjoying again! üòâ,5
My experience with this game has been fun. The only problem is the zombie mode it's to difficult. Y'all need to make it easier. I'm a very very very good player so for me to be saying that the zombie mode is to hard then it is very hard.,4
"This is a good game, it's a big conglomeration of cod multiplayer it has lots of weapons and plenty of maps it has a large data requirement to download everything but I think it's worth it in app purchases are available but not necessary although it's the only way to get certain weapon skins, the battle royal mode has plenty of neat features that make it more enjoyable than some other battle royal games, sadly the zombies mode is mainly defense based objectives, I would recommend this to anyone",5
"Good game and good graphics but the game just got hard all the sudden, you get killed with one or two bullets from an assault riffle even if you have full armo and full health. The updates are crazy big. I've been playing this game for 2 years now and I love it, but please fix it",3
"Its a great game. With high graphics, smooth gameplay etc, I like this game's controls too! I have not encountered any bug till now, maybe, if there's an error, I will say that. And I don't have any router or wifi, but suprisingly, it is running nice on my vivo Y21.",5
"It's also the best first-person shooter I've yet played on a phone. The microtransactions are a problem, just as they've become a problem in mainline Call of Duty titles, but fans who don't mind that annoyance will love the mobile version. You can play Call of Duty: Mobile on Android and iOS so smoothly",5
It's one of the best game I've ever played but since 3 seasons I have been having this issue where when I'm playing br my game crashes mid game everytime... And since season 13 I've been having this problem for ranked mp also many are facing this problem... Is this situation continues I'll stop playing and many will.... So pls do take this into consideration and fix this pls,3
I thought I'd try this out as an old school COD fan. I can deal with tutorials but one that forces multiplayer and does not allow you to invert your camera during the tutorial is a bad design. I still haven't found out how to invert the camera.,1
"Love the game except for a few issues,when playing a sniper only match we don't need to hear our player yelling sniper! Every 2 sec also the enemy Insight parameters definitely need tweaking. You can literally stand face against the wall and will still hear enemy in sight, if they aren't in our vision they're not in sight. Stop putting players in matches underway,",5
"This game has a very great graphics, although it is on mobile but thereafter it has very great graphics, but 1 thing I didn't like from this that developers removes the old multiplayer while adding the new one for example in 1v1 dual before it has two maps gulag and other one also I liked the gulag one most but they removed that both maps for adding another two maps I request the creator that please add the gulag map in 1v1 dual cause I liked that map the most, Thanks.",5
"Everything is great exept for some challenges that require kills is ranked since it doesnt depend on skill just luck,the higher you are in ranked the harder it is the lower you are in ranked the easier it is so please just stop doing that. And also stop doing 10 updates every week since the gb stacks up",4
Best shooter game on mobile. Gameplay is fantastic and graphics look really good depending on your device's capabilities. Some times can be Pay to Win and meta weapons are always over powered. Multiplayer and Battle royale lobbies are filled with bots EVEN IN RANKED and may make the experience very bad. Overall the game is good but need some changes.,3
"This is the best br and multi-player game on the play store. Activision done a great job making the game if you want a first person shooter choose this but the only disadvantage is the space if you play on a 64 GB storage phone it runs smoothly but 32 GB it's a little slow but there is no lag in game, only on the lobby screen it's slow. Apart from that it's a 100% recommended.",4
"I realy like this Call Of Duty Mobile, good sound, good graffics, good game, I've made lots friends from all over the world, it's a great game. Its lot's of long fun hrs of group combat fun. To the development personal; how about trowing a few matches for a chance to get weapons, emotes, upgrades etc. Just a thought, any way, congrats, keep up the good.",5
Persistence should be nerfed. In ranked matches opposing team is not even good but they still win just because they just spam scorestreaks at the end of the game. This is happening in every ranked match. It is really frustrating to lose just because i didn't use Persistence. I wont play the game until its fixed.,1
"I never had problems with this game and suddenly it just crash all the time. Besides the probability of the mythic/ legendary weapons is stupid, you have to spend at least 100$ to play 10times, and instead of creating challenge where you can earn at least a minimum amount of CP they just offer you the free ones, which the combination are catastrophic, looks like there was 0‚Äå motivation when they created them.Hardcore mode should be available always, there are players as me who enjoys more this",1
"Try to reduce the size of the game by taking out unnecessary maps, skins, etc that wouldn't be used in the current season. A little more optimization to the movement and the frame rates could be done as well.",3
"I still love playing this game, but after you get the Damascus camo there is almost nothing to do. I know there are a lot of seasonal and featured challenges, but after you get Damascus, all the skins for your weapons mean absolutely nothing. Another problem I have is that I have every single weapon in the game maxed, and have about 2000 xp cards in reserve. I think you should be able to trade them in for credits in the game. Also, ranked needs to help solo queuers more in terms of xp for ranks.",2
"It would be nice to have a button in the game linked to a website out of the game (less storage consume) which has all the bundles and crates and draws and ... ever released. The ""for you"" is a nice feature but I think devs know that this is the main thing to focus on. Also a BR training loby would be great so that we could see damage ranges and damage numbers. Also in ranked while getting 80 ping, my enemy has 20. And they laugh thinking that I am a bot and they are the proest people.",3
"New season 11 update is not opening my game, always stuck at main screen ""network error, try again later"". I'm restarting the game constantly, clear cashes and so on and on, can just open BR from that menu. But before that it was always fine. 5 stars, changed it to 4 just hv hopes it got fix soon, south asian servers",5
"graphics arent great, horribly constructed character skins, very ugly weapon skins, impossible to win a weapon in a drop you want, all good dlc are only in china, constant glitching, lags, controller players, ugly weapon camos even demascus, zombies is boring, battle royal is also lame because its mostly bots, worst customer service ive seen in years. I was not helped at all when i was hacked. Yes the game is sometimes fun with friends besides all major issues. If you want to risk it, play!",1
After this recent or last update my game is crashing a lot!!!! In all the modes. And the FPS is too low where I can see my avatar lagging big time also few times whike I was playing BR mode my avatar just froze for a min or 2 where I can hear my teams voice but my control and screen is frozen. At first I though its because of my Mobile or my network connection. But I heared it from my friends too where they all have some pretty good phones with good RAM and Graphic quality. Even in Emulator too.,1
"I've been giving this game a 5-star rating, but I'm giving 3 stars. Firstly, I don't know why we have to redownload all operators, soldier skins, camos and all upon release of a new season; that's totally not cool. Secondly, even after I download the soldier skins, when I'm playing (especially BR), I still can't see other players' skins. I think our guys should try to fix this glitch, so the game goes smoothly also for those with low-end phones.",3
Best 1st person shooting game on android but for some reason my ps4 controller wont work properly. Seems I'm not the only one with this issue. Been half a year now. Would have thought it would have been fixed. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars,3
I've been playing this game since it was in beta mode and it's great. Only time it may glitch for me is during some 10v10 modes. Downloads/Upgrades can sometimes be annoying as they take up space. But other than that all good. Currently playing on a Samsung S21.,5
"It's not as great as it once was, but still SOMEWHAT enjoyable. Despite the very broken weapons that last forever, a perk they refuse to nerf in anyway (Persistence), and so many issues and bugs that can make the game unbearable.",3
Best game ever its even better than the real warzo e except it keeps crashing but I also have a lot of storage on device but my only concern is ir happens on my old one and this one is brand new so I hope u can fix it and stop having it crash for no reason or because of storage thank-you also fixed zombies to make it like the original from blackops one - five and not these little mission ones thank-you,5
"This is my favorite game. I like it and every thing is good the battle pass and season is also the best. This I a request can you please make call of duty mobile like call of duty warzone? People will love it as the game will be a bit challenging, competitive and fun. I wanted to give a five but sorry üòî because of the above reason I cannot. Overall this is a very good game.",4
"This game is awesome, it's fun and really feels like a call of duty game, but the main problem is the the controller, when I started playing with a Xbox one S controller the I had problems with its controls besides that, the game is good. RECOMMENDED TRYING IT.",5
"The game has gotten better than before with every update its getting better and better with more players joining, the thing i don't like is it just takes to much space and the shoot threw walls is really getting on my nerves, when ever I try to run threw a door i get shoot and run back in but I just get myself killed by getting shoot threw the wall (especially in battle royal ) and thats why I didn't give it a 5 star.",5
"Tried to reinstall and play the game, says ""download configuration failed."" No matter what I do, it will not open. I have enough storage and I'm on a 5g home network connection with max strength. I would love to play again, but can't.",2
"One of the best mobile games. The controls are easy and loads of customisation options and tons of maps and modes to try from. My personal favourite is swords,sticks and stones which was limited time only but very enjoyable.",5
"It's a bad and unfair game because when I was playing ranked match I spawned In a different area than the enemies and the just a enemy spawns right behind me so bad game this is don't play it, but after the recent update the game has been pretty good its working perfectly fine and no lag issues for me but yeah one thing it just suddenly goes to 199ms with good network and freeze and you die then. And it shows that you have been banned for hacking for me it has happen like 2 times not a big deal.",3
"A good game, but more work needs to be put into optimisation. I used to be able to run this on my tablet perfectly fine, but now I have to deal with the game absolutely tanking frames for several seconds leading to lost fights constantly.",3
"Absolutely mad! I got to the maximum level (150) and had to update. It didn't want to update so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it again. Only to find that I had to start from the beginning. It won't let me back up my account from my linked Google account and I didn't know I had to make an Activision account. If you can fix this and get me my account back, I'll rate it five stars.",1
"I have been playing this game for around a year. I have played COD before also have played Warzone. But on mobile device this one is the best. I did try other FPS games like PUBG, Battleground etc. This one is more realistic than all. You actualy have to control your gun recoil and not just use aim assist as other games. Except some ping issues, some lyag during updates. this game runs smooth.",4
"Everything's great except the updates. Updating a game is an important thing to do but the updating the game takes too much of my time & internet data as each update is 1 to 1.2 GB... Please do something, my phone is not a quantum computer. My internal memory is limited! 3 stars for the smoothness & gameplay of the game. ‚Äì A C.O.D Fan",3
"This game was really nice and enjoyable. Now, I have to wait for a long time before have starts and there is always a new download everyone the game starts. Despite this, your new update is 1gb? For real? 1gb? This is just annoying. I can't even play a quick game in tea break at work anymore. Also, the game now lags. You just have to fix it. Really.",1
"Really good game with nice graphics and seasonly weapons and maps..but a tech prblm that when an update comes and I start the update then when it reaches 100%, it pauses and no further installment takes place and I have to cancel the whole update and start again..it may be play store's issue but please look at it..coz it takes lot of storage and time",4
"I have been waiting over an hour for this ""seasons 3 spring"" package to download so I can actually play the game and it has been in loading mode the whole time and has cut off all my access to featured multiplayer mode until downloaded but will not download. I have plenty of space on my phone so I don't know why it has been taking so long but I would like to get back to being able to play the game please.",4
"Fun game, apart from the occasional freeze up and black screen requiring a restart, it has allowed me some quality family time with 4 of my sons, without the cost of a long distance phone call.!.üëç *update* no issues after uninstalling Android webview.",4
"Its almost exactly like the online version you see on the consoles, controls are odd at first, but you catch on quick. Im hooked, I LOVE this game. The only downside, is every time they release a new update. The file size seems to triple. Now so where i can either choose CoD, and have zero other apps on my phone. Or install and continue pouring money into it. Because i have no room anymore.",4
Really nice game. All those operator skills in multi-player and all those classes in BR. My favorite operator skill is the Shadow Blade and my favorite class is Trickster. All these things are not available in the most popular shooting game in the BGMI/PUBG. You can get free epic skins in this game. The skins with that finish message. So many legendary skins. Some may characters you can get for free. Brilliant game. No complaints from my side. I play 2 finger in this. Absolutely no lag.,5
"Maps that are on random seems to pick the same maps Everytime back to back. Not sure why I jump up to 199 and 200ms during most games especially when I'm in a ranked mode. Also when you throw like a Molotov, if a teammate coincidentally walk in front of you, it could hit off of them and could potentially self-kill.",4
1) in multiplayer you just sometimes find yourself thrown into a loosing team match. 2) when a match starts in mp im always last to go 3) when people slide they cant be shot 4)people with katanas are faster than bullets 5) dogs take many bullets to die 6) game loading takes time 7) not getting xps after completing some matches. Overall the game is great,4
"Spent a lot of money with this game. One purchase had a glitch and I didn't receive. Spent hours with customer service for a 99 cent issue. They wanted a dozen differnt copies, including 5 differnt screen shots and purchase history. My purchase history goes back 2 years! The ridiculous amount of time for a 99 cent purchase problem is completely ridiculous and seems to be set up so you don't ask for help or credit that you should get immediately with the receipt in question.",1
"Due to new update, game crashes many time, when game start map is blanked and also glitches are there unable to jump and also the maps are not visible. Loadout also got blanked, sniper scope is not there unable to play game. Do something fast. Thank you",2
The app is great and I love being able to play COD any time I want without having to be on my playstation but after about 2 or 3 the app closes out completely and I have to reload it's a bit annoying but all in all it's a great app and a great game I like all of the new modes I can play it's not just multiplayer zombies and campaign if the bug for the app closing gets fixed the game would be amazing and I will give it five stars after that,3
Great game! I love the verity of maps on Multiplayer and the locations on BR... I've been waiting for a long time for zombies to come back tho that's probably my only issue but otherwise great game! Runs very smoothly on the right devise and is lots of fun!,5
"Half the time the map doesn't show the enemy, before its too late. Another game that's dependent on how deep your pocket is and not skill or tactics. Apparent when playing ranked match with the amount of players that quit during the match.",2
This game is awesome 100% like the graphics the maps the characters and weapons but the only thing that I absolutely hate about this game is that you have to constantly update its like everyday there's a new boring update that is not even worth it and waits my storage now I'm planning on just deleting it üò¨ it takes up way to much storage.,3
"Playing since appx starting of the game. But it's true that since last 2-3 updates, the optimisation issue getting bigger and bigger by the day. Even with 8 GB RAM also, it's lagging very badly. However love this game very much. So request to developers to fix this issue soon.",2
"4/5 because while the gameplay and graphics are great and all, storage is a bit of an issue. It's amazing overall, but please figure out a way for this game to not take up so much space please.",4
"My Call of Duty Mobile experience has been splendid. The game is absolutely terrific and it gives us the users the ability to choose from a wide range of game modes. If you're looking for the best online FPS shooter game on mobile, I recommend you go for this one. I can assure you that you wont regret it. üòÅüëçüèΩ",5
"So many ads. And update after update. It's insane! It forces you to update. Every time I get on to play I am required to update. Really annoying It's not like it's a small, quick update either. I have great internet and it takes 5 minutes to install. Sometimes it just sits on 99% for half the time!",1
"Alright, look. The game play is exceptional. No other mobile games in it's class even comes close.... However, the damn updates are way to long to download and install! And the seasons are are way to short. Season 5 already? The debut season(season 1) was the longest and every season should be at least that amount of time. Feel me? üíØüëç",5
"Game is fantastic. Great graphics, typical mobile shooter game layout. Does require a bit of RAM to run, if you have issues you prob don't have enough. They warn you before each update to link your guest acct to avoid losing progress, and you can just make a cod account ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è from the opening screen, Imagine that. Stop bringing ratings down for your own mess ups guys, c'mon. I've been playing (without spending) for only a week and I'm a GrandMaster iv In BR ranked. You don't have to pay at all.",5
The game isn't to bad but everytime a game pushes for more money more issues arrive. Lag issues button issues. Getting into a car and it comes to a stop you jump out and bam the car kills you. When games become more money hungry is when I loose interest.,2
"It's alright, the game plays well but it's gone down hill they got rid of adrenaline and gives you a shield also the zombies map isn't the greatest. Hope they go back to the other features.",3
"The game is very detailed and really makes you feel like you're playing CoD on PC or Console. However, to play this game you have to get ready to delete half the contents of your phone, this game takes up about 2-3 GB of space and requires another 2GB in a new update. Playing the game is worth the storage space depending on what you have to uninstall to access it. (I had to uninstall around 67 other games and apps like Google Docs, PUBG, and various assistant apps to play)",4
"Was a 5 star but now I can even play any longer because of all the f#!%ing dlc. All the work I did for my player is just gone, even on the lower HD cause now I can't even open the game without the download which I have no room for now. And believe me, I tried, but there are apps on my mobile that I need to have. COD is the only game I have right now too. It's a drag, I was getting so into this game and then the rug, right out from under me. So thanks but no thanks I guess. Gotta delete.",1
After this update the game started to lag many times. I hadn't any issues with the previous versions. But the gameplay looks great even though there is a need of optimization. Btw i have this problem in a SD 732G Soc. I don't know about other soc's.,3
It used to run just fine. But after the latest update every time I enter a match the game disconnects . And it's happening with all of my friends too. So I guess the problem is not from my end. So there's no other way then to quit. It's just disappointing that's all.(originally gave 5 *),4
I mean this games all right it does a lot of glitching and like when the game starts up when you start around like you're the last one to be able to move and is very annoying like everybody runs ahead of you so when you go just like this one game that has a b and c you're the last one to make it to that circle because it lags but overall it's addictive truly dislike the glitching I wish they would fix it,3
"Like the game alot just have one problem, thing is I like to have it on automatic shot so all I have to focus on is aiming and reloading the problem is sometimes it won't shoot at all I've lost more games this way then when it functioning properly what's with this ?",5
please add van's as well. Also driving car should be more realistic It's good to experience graphics and all scenes. Little change for vehicle controls not good. Also please other vehicles like unusable cars side of road,4
"I've been playin codm since it came out awesome game best graphics and game modes my only small lil problem is when theres an uptade you have to download everythn again like maps, weapons, skins, etc. Takes a little to long ... Cod plz fix this and make it all together would make it easier for all of us üôè",4
It's great gets updates every month mp is good and zombies is coming back after getting removed attachments are good the game has a motherload of guns and the game gets new guns every season so I would definitely recommend if your into shooter games but side note the ranked mp mode is not great because if your phone makes the game crash it gets you banned I kept on getting crashes on ranked so it eventually got up to a 5 hour ban but other than that I would recommend,5
Overall this game is amazing bit there is one issue the size of the updates I don't know what it is for but the updates are quite a bit like for example the latest one is over 2gb and this is for a mobile game please could you make a lite version of the game or make an option for very low graphics,2
I don't like getting rid of my other apps that I really do need just to update this don't get me wrong I really do like this app but there is one more thing I don't like it when it lags when u go in to play but other then that I love it...üëçüèæ It would be nice for this game to connect to the game system like the PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Xbo box 1X I really do love playing this game wish you can just go out with other game systems so everybody can play that would be nice,5
Amazing game but it takes so much storage üòûüòû. Rn it takes up 7.87Gb I don't have much storage and I have to delete everything to get this game to update. I really love this game. But I can't play it anymore it takes up all my storage. Plz change how much storage it needs. I would be willing to pay for things on this app but it lags so much when I do buy things. I'm honestly disappointed. Plz change it,4
"I started playing and the system would kick me out of ranked matches once in a blue moon, I just thought its normal, but in the last few weeks the game has been kicking me out of ranked matches and regular matches, it has done it so much that I was dropped 3 levels on ranked matches, I had considered spending money on this game but after this display.... no way will I spend money on a faulty game. Update since then the game has improved keep it up",4
"Exactly like the original no forced in game purchases great app love it. But right now, im having a pop up before the game loads up saying to download season 3 of cod and it takes me to the play store but theres nothing to install. And i have to close the game because theres no other way to get rid of the popup",4
Please fix the desync in game. It is really hard to play ranked matches as your shots don't connect with low ping players in addition to dying to them before we even see them. I've been playing since the game was released and this wasn't a problem then.,4
"Great gaming experience but I did decided to play and I got to the part that I have to login,the auto login did not go through,and I pressed the Facebook to login it keeps loading then it tells me ""logintime out"" .it happens for a very long time so I decided to uninstall and install but it's still the same l, can't play with my friends for no reason...",1
"I've played every single Call of Duty. This one is very good, especially for mobile. Most of my friends are on here now lol. But their is 2 problems. 1. The cheaters in this game are ridiculous, I'm level 150 and I somehow have always managed to get legendary rank for br each season but it has taken quite a while to get that rank please do something about the cheats/cheaters. Problem #2. Storage. This is the only game on my phone. This takes up so much damn storage that I have 1Gb left out of 32",3
"Call of Duty has been my favorite since it's first game in 2003. It's graphics are just over the line. Vast variety of amazing guns, Characters and matches in multiplayer as well as in Battle Royal. Amazing maps. Game becomes even more amazing with every new update. Another reason for me loving this game is their strict action against hackers. This game rocks!! And if you are reading this review, I warm-heartedly recommend you this game.",5
I've been playing this game for 3yrs now and C.O.D mobile has not made any changes to the hacking that has been going on of late ... and it's pretty annoying knowing that I'm a paying customer that has to deal with cheaters on a regular basis ..and oh might I add that I'm spending more then needed for these draws .. if you made the CP more accessible for people to ACTUALLY get these prizes it wouldn't be so bad.. at times I feel like I'm wasting a significant amount of money on that,3
"For multiplayer its really good,but for battle royale it sucks. First off the armor plate idea sucks, it just makes the game fortnite. Second, healing idea sucks, if you're in the zone you're basically dead unless you make it out of the zone. on top of that there are soo many glitches now, swimming glitch where u go under water for a few seconds and u come up to breath oxygen you still lose oxygen. The cars glitch into stuff a lot. And my iron sight keep vanishing which means i cant ads(scope).",3
"The best FPS game for mobile. Whilw there are some annoying things (katana, thermite, dogs) the game is still perfectly enjoyable even as a f2p! Most of the guns are balanced except for season meta and its always fun to look forward to new maps and modes.",5
"Great game, smooth and not laggy. Good graphics, its possible to be the best without grinding which is a plus and the ability to get an avatar from the monthly logins are cool. The events are interesting and this is the first fps game I've not gotten bored of and have played every day multiple times.",5
"The concept is great, but they constantly screw you out of your rewards, I preregestered for the game for special mickey outfit, didn't recieve it, when I asked about it they confirmed that I preregistered but refused to award the outfit, they force you to play the way they want you too ex they make you play with and have to level the characters that they want you to, wasting the rescources youve been saving to build the charaters you want, and good luck with purchases, Vip2x but only recieved 1",2
This is one of my favorite games and I just can't seem to get enough of it but I'll only complain about how laggy it is when I'm playing a match and when I'm trying to shoot an enemy and it's quite frustrating not being able to play and getting the other team a free kill because I couldn't shoot them properly since I was lagging I really hope you guys fix this because I really do love this game but I can't play if there's so much lag,5
"There's so many better fps that fix the issue of syncing characters and head glitches yet yall fail to do that on the multiplayer but you continue to shil crates that require cod points that we'll never get bc they are payed currency. If your gonna monetize your game ,fix it. You couldn't even add a decent zombie mode even tho there is already a basic layout for it. The hit boxes are so awful and then u add ridiculous skins that don't have proper hit boxes like can't yall fix the lag, etc first",1
"Nice haptics and in game control features. Nice experience for normal phones also. And gun animations and sounds are so cool and satisfying. Movement while holding the gun looks so realistic. Although need few changes, but from a gamer user like me it's upvoted.",4
FPS that actually looks good and functions properly with regular updates. For free. Don't want to play on your phone? Grab your favorite controller and connect to your phone and cast to a TV. Free COD on a big screen.,5
I am the battousai with the striker!!!!!!! Only complaint I have is the controller not connecting bug. You have to connect your controller first then boot the game so it will register with said controller. The only fix I know of is completely removing the game reinstalling the game again and connecting said controller before betting the game up. Other than that no real complaints.,5
"This game is good. Even though you have costume guns and weapons ,if you will customise a gun in slot one and then choose another gun,the gun which is there in the 1st slot will be like that only it will not change... that's the best thin in this game...is I fell. The graphics in this game is also good even though you did'nt download the HD pack...that's also a good part of this game",4
Well the game is not smooth! The zombie map is limited time from Christmas so what I can to say it's getting really boring I hope new season update will improve the situation but hopes is really low. I hope situation can by improved as at the moment it's worst call of duty I played so far....,2
"This is a really fun game, ive been playing since the beta testing of the game but I would've given it a five star but I cant seem to play zombies, if you could get that fixed that would be appreciated, thank you. Edit: I have given this game a 5 star review, now that the Zombies game mode has be re-released, it is much more fun and enjoyable, I suggest getting this game, thank you",5
The reason I gave 4 stars is that in BR mode if I take Close range fight I have to hit more bullets than enemy. He just knock and finish in just half magazine but there is no problem with my network and ping. I know there is no glitch in this game that's why I love this game but i get so frustrated whenever it happen to me. Plz do something.,4
"Great game top graphics but can do with some bugs fixes more assault rifles, add attack choppers in game, also would be nice if we could carry 3 firearms and we would appreciate it if we in Africa had our own server since we suffer a lot against players from other countries since they have much higher ping than we do",3
Well it's a good game but my phone prolly dose it but the game glitches every hour or min and it's really frustrating to the point where you have to turn off your phone and then turn it back on. But you also have to wait for it to load and it's loads like three or four times. But over all it's OKAY...,2
Its not a bad game. Graphics is top notch. Battle pass works out.. Pay to win guns are boss.. But these do not matter if we're hitting pings of between 80 ms and 110 ms.. Like its near impossible to keep up with players who have their own servers in their countries hitting between 10 ms and 50 ms.. 1 star is all I'm giving it until we get servers in South Africa..,1
"A nice MP experience, although lacks the dynamic and robust mechanics of a BR mode. BR lags behind when compared to the likes of PUBGM. edit: Like the fact that every new season brings at least two new functional weapons. Always keeps the meta changing.",4
"Warning! This game may make you want to smash your phone because of the ballshit! Gameplay would be excellent if it weren't for stupid glitches!!! When I drive a car and try to get out, I sometimes get stuck and opponent blows up my car.. The amount of times I got killed because of some stupid glitches! There are times where I tried to press the shoot button but the game doesn't respond (nothing wrong with my phone btw) sometimes I get blocked by some unknown object! Fix your game!!!",1
I have played call of duty for the longest niw i love this game to death when i come to schools i get on and i enjoy the battle passes this is one of the best mobile games ever made!,5
My game got crash i have good device at all this is first time gotting this crash i think after update may be its bug or anything else This makes fear i lost my account or something else plz call of duty fix this plz,2
"Game is awesome but it needs to chill on the usage of storage bc now I might have to delete the game bc theres so much in this new update, also the controller bug where it takes my controller and locks it up so I can't move my joysticks and makes me spin in circles is gonna have to be fixed bc I'm fr like getting absolutely frustrated that this update did sum to it and now I can't play",4
This game is amazing great graphics & good gameplay but there's something about it that's kind of annoying which is the fact that there's always gonna be more attachments & sometimes I check it & there's no attachments but other than that. Great game! & I look forward to future up dates :),5
"with a new new thing in the event ""with the return of the soldiers"" changed last reward (epic skin) and were not given the right to choose a reward please do something about it. (google translate)",2
The controller option isn't being picked up all the time. Please fix. I can connect my controller but can move. Fix the programing üôè,2
"This game was awesome in 2019. I used to play it a lot. Since then, they have added TOO MUCH unnecessary clutter. I am not the only one who feels this way. Read other reviews, people are saying that their FPS has dropped since the last update and they are right. The heavy updates are more than just maps and weapons. This is NOT a MMORPG where you have a gazillion items! It's a simple FPS and should remain that way!",2
I enter the app and it works right. Then it stops when I try to connect with my google accpunt. Help !!,4
Its a great game but the only problem is the amount of space it takes and I end have to uninstall it so I can even use my phone. It does say 2.4gb or something like that when downloaded but afterwards it takes like 8 or 10 GB of your space I don't know the exact amount. But I love the game and never get bored of it I just hope that they can reduce the size of the game to allow players such as me and others to play the game without worrying about how much space it takes.,2
"I just started playing in January 2022 and I've been enjoying the game so far. Great graphics and audio, etc. The only issue is having to download player skins I initially had after each update. Please fix",5
"This game is the most toxic game out there, ranked is full of presestance and thermites and the time to kill is toooooooooo fast to the point at which a assault rifle can kill faster then a sniper. Fix your game Activision, esprorts is the only thing keeping the game alive.",1
I've been playing this game since it came out. One of the best optional pay games in the app store. They need to work on its device compatibility because alot of phones crash the app consistently. Other than that I think it is a great game.,5
My kid installed this on my phone.... now he doesn't get to use my phone at all anymore hahaha there is lag from time to time here in South Africa... its amazing in HD but quite happy to run it at lowest spec... has been a few times on certain weapons it shows as a pink texture map while upgrading gun but otherwise awesome üëå,5
"Totally addictive,what every gamer wants,keep it up with the upgrades!!! But then the COD points cost way too much for people that don't spend money you know,please look into that! A Africa needs a server already jeez!",4
"Excellent fun good time for a distraction addictive experience ,,outstanding graphics/sound best through headphones for a Mobile game. I play every day to check off daily login for rewards, but the new caricatures are always put on just passed the cut off daily date thus Deming unattainable why is that so please fix your error",2
Every month there's a large download that needs to happen and you have to get it in order to keep playing. Since release the game has been spiraling downward on creativity when it comes to their characters. I only get on to get the daily reward and that's about it now. Losing faith in the developers of this franchise.,1
You need to change microphones back to the way they were. this is terrible trying to communicate with teammates now. Please,2
The game size increse on day by day. My device low end device. It's lot of bugs and lags in the game. I can't play BR squad or Duo matches. It's very laggy. Some times bot foot print displayed but no enemy. Weapons displayed as Boxes. Enemy skins are all bot skins. Sometimes crash the game near the enemies. There are no sounds or display enemies vehicle. Please fix the bugs for low end devices.,1
Never have I ever had an issue with this game. I've walked away for a few seasons now and apparently there updates you've devs have changed. Well for the Razer phone 2 the resolution for display is ridiculously high. Any apps that appear like chat bubbles. The phone freezes after everything you load. Playing a match is impossible but it was never like this before. What happened?,1
"Terrible. Don't bother playing this game if you're in countries like South Africa as there are no servers so the ping disadvantage is great, you can forget playing competitively. Trash game, trash dev team, trash weapons. If you want to waste your time playing a game look elsewhere",1
"So, for Android and iPhone I've noticed differences. IPhone has more access to new features alot sooner than Android. Doing the daily log in for a month I'm already 3 days later than the version on iPhone. I was unlocking a character today but now the update stopped that and now I can't even log into the game to play. Yet the iPhone can. Please fix this issue.",4
Absolutely love the game. But after latest update (march 2020) the game freezes abruptly in BR mode. Device info: Asus ROG PHONE 2 ANDROID 10,5
"This game is full of cheaters. I have been playing for two and a half years, and every day I put a web video of cheaters in the Anista gram page. Diyat is not useful at all",1
"Not a bad game when it works as intended BUT... It's absolutely sickening the amount of times you do a challenge and it doesn't count it, been a problem for long time now and shows zero signs of being addressed, restarting game doesn't work, clearing cache for the game doesn't work and re-installing doesn't work! Soooo many weapons and outfits etc... I've missed out on now because the devs either are incapable of fixing it or they're not interested in fixing it...",2
"I do like the game but I can't seem to change to the maximum graphics option, some forums say that it's because my phone can't handle it but I'm using the Samsung Galaxy S22 ultra, it can handle it. Kindly fix the bug yh.",1
"No proper servers for people from South Asia, we get thrown into Japanese and Middle east servers where other players have 10-15ms pings while we have to play on above 80ms ping which puts us in a severe disadvantage. Enemies and vehicles don't render in battle royale unless the enemies are really close for low end mobile users which makes it really hard to play battle royale.",1
Extremely bad since last update. I updated my game. Only to not be able to play any of the game modes at all. I uninstalled it and re installed it. It does the same thing still. When you load into a game it constantly glitches back every second and the game is unplayable. I have a good data connection so that's not the problem it worked fine before the update.,1
"I love it but I hate it. Freaking space freak game! I hate that. Awesome game to be honest. Even after freeing up 3GB for latest update it still wants me to free up additional 2.8gb by deleting my apps. I hate it so much. If it wasn't for such a freaking storage freak of a game I'd give it a 5 star once off... You can't expect me to delete my business apps for a pleasure game, I can't keep doing this. Keep on installing and unistalling. No options to even move to my SD Card it's just a pain.....",3
After update it freezes constantly and randomly. Changed settings; no effect,2
The gameplay is good but..... developers need to remove chat. Watch and listen in.... nothing but bullies... worst chat option on the net. Including 4chan. Very dissatisfied.... i go to stand off 2 instead.,1
Why every time I try to open call of duty game its telling me Download configuration fail .... My WiFi is connected I close game and try same thing I'm seeing I restart my phone üì± and same problem,2
"Great game and nice graphics, the only problem is that I can not sign into my main account ever since I changed my device, I have been playing with my guest account ever since, please I need that to be rectified for me.",5
There is a optimization problem in game When i played battle royale sometimes it's lagging very highly and i think the developer need to update their optimization settings and fix all the bug S71 gaming ü•∞,5
I love the game but there are too many cheaters in it and you can tell who the cheaters are they move away faster they shoot way faster it's because they're using a controller in a mobile game order using a mouse in a keyboard on a computer it's called call-of-duty-mobile for a reason so I just had to quit playing because there's too many cheaters I have the same gun and shoot and I get killed with one shot but it takes 6 shots to kill them yeah they're cheating but I really did love it,3
Love this game... Would love to see an offline mode... I see theirs vs AI so you could make it so that's offline like the console games! Please add this I can't find any other shooter game and I can't find a offline one that's compatible and good!,5
I'm sorry about my recent review I was just to stubborn to realize I had it made playing on 30 ping and all of a sudden lost confidence in my sniping in game bit as of now the game works great I dont recommend any future nerfs to any of the weapons because they all work great just like they are thank you for providing such a great all around GAME and for those who wanna know what the best gun in this game is its between the SPR208 OR THE DLq33,5
Way too many glitches.. my ping spikes up even though my internet is perfectly alright. I get stuck in pre match sequence and keep on reconnecting but I can't see my teammates nor the enemy. The audio is always glitched it doesnt turn on to friends until I press it for a 100 times. I won't be playing this anymore.,2
I really liked it it's soo cool it is one of my best. For a mobile game it has really good graphics and it is my most played game till now I started playing In the first month of its release and I am happy to see its growth also other than skins and weapon exp cards it is mostly fair but there is 1 thing I would like you to fix that if you are removed from the game for internet issues it shouldn't deduct your rank exp and everything I am fine with. Thank you,5
It's pretty good to play this game...the graphics is clear but we need a campaign mode because of some people don't really play on multiple and Battle royal,4
Good until recently... lost all my progress! I didn't play for 2 months and updated the app today. Had to retake the stupid training and everything was erased. Had all my weapons and setup the way I knew i liked it. What the hell happened. Such a freakin bummer. Kinda discouraged to begin again and hope that my progress isn't deleted again.,2
Game is good in everything but ehat is wrong with sniper and marksman rifle. It is impossible to aim with hipfire. Plzz make it easy man decrease that spread of bullet those guns are meant to be for accuracy and long range.,4
This game STARTS of great. And then they add a set of things that eventually cause the game to stick and have some terrible glitches. And they refuse to fix that issue and just add things. Other than that it's good,3
Still no zombies.... I'd give 0 stars if I could. Promises that it will return safe to say it ain't going to. New version ain't quite like zombies always has been like its supposed to be a survival of rounds so you can test yourself and have fun with friends should make another game just for the old version of zombies or add it back in as a option,1
I tried updating three times still it doesn't get updated. It's reaches till 100% and gets stuck!!! And top of that your every new season update is so huge that I run out of data!,1
Unable to login the game and worst app . After connecting wifi it's showing like make sure internet connected on you device WTH Wrong with this app. don't download this app simply wasting a time and storage,1
"So good, I was never a cod fan, but this mobile version really turned me into a big fan. You do have a way to let the graphics low so you can play on any low price phone, and its really easy to get nice skins.",5
"üëéüëéüëéüëéCOD Mobile COD MOBILE NEEDS to change Developers the game is turning to boring and downgrading the WEPONS because some one says ( is overpowered )it doesn't means is over powered .Stop Downgrading the WEPONS I paid for . Trap master it's unreal it shouldn't be in the game booster shouldn't be in the game Rewind Shouldn't be in the game ,and please monitor the movements of the players because the are in a speed that is to fast for others ,OR WE ALL FAST OR ALL SLOW .StopChangingTheF..Sett",1
"Friends account got lost, had to restart it. They can't locate lost accounts. So make sure you link it to something else or else you'll have to restart too. Don't bother emailing support, you'll just get empty platitudes.",1
"I was enjoying the game...... All of a sudden anytime I want to log in it gives me ""authorization error""... Even after reinstalling the game, it's still the sameüò°. Pls fix this",2
You guys are actually unserious. Firstly it's a very nice game but pls try to optimize this game...like the lag people get when they use low end devices isn't nice at all like must I purchase the most expensive phone to play a game?...And I will load my game and it'll tell me timeout like what d hell....I guess I'll move to apex if this changes aren't made but although it's a very good game...but pls adhere to this complains üëçüíî,3
Very bad game.. No maintenance.. Lag frame drop network error r common thing nowadays.. Its not even playable anymore.. Time to switch in apex lgends.. And other upcoming better games..... Why this game stuck at 100 % nd not installing.. Season 5 full of bugs..,1
This is a good game but every update is like 1 GB and your most likely going to have to delete at least one app like for season 5 i had to delete almost 3 apps and yet i never even got to play and CODM takes up all of your storage so you cant even play CODM because CODM is already like 11 GB,4
"I play it each and everyday it's an amazing game I love to play it I enjoy it I don't get any problems with it or it never crashes but I can't play my music with it, it just automatically stops but I have to play it again but it's still an amazing game the best graphics",5
"Please fix the lag, it's really bad. I play competitive but there is also a request for you guys to add camouflages for when a whole category of guns is diamond and when all guns are diamond. I am closing in so please do it!!!!",5
I was surprised how fun this game is. Great graphics. If you want to do well use the aim feature. Just saying. Wish there were less bots. You play online and kill 8 bots and two real people.,5
"The game play, graphics and everything is lit . The high tech war machines and so on... honestly the games is 100% lit. Buh please producers I'll really love that as there is a chopper in battle royale that there aswell be a jet fighter.. to make the game much more combating... Kudos to COD mobile",5
This is not good I didn't understand every time I login but it's saying time out what the hell is happening. Even email and facebook not working wow great you think I'm hacking your stupid game are something are else . Any way thanks for the deleting my facebook login good luck your stupid game. ü§îüôÑüòéüòä. It's best game to me I think new update not working or something else. That's all üëãüëãüëã,4
"Very great game, I also enjoy playing it on a daily. I recently begin to have problems with the game crashes, any suggestions on how to fix this problem?",5
I am playing and enjoying this game since pubg was banned in India. The size of the app is more than 12 GB and it is most probably for lots of map. Downloading only 1 or 2 maps of choice will be more helpful to players. Otherwise the game is awesome no doubt about it.,4
"It's the best mobile gave I have ever played, perfect gameplay, great graphics and super game modes, this game is the best, don't miss it.",5
Its a blast to play. The only thing i would change is to make the undead/zombie gameplay last longer than 2 rounds.,5
the only thing i would request everyone it' lags a lot while gamming and plz don't go for any lucky draw weapons because they are useless with fake shots while gamming. if this lagging continue then every purchase will be an useless one.....so stop stupid updates and fix up lags...,2
"After large amounts of updates this game is easily the best cod game in the series the dedication to improvements and balances is beyond anything current, aside from controller players still getting less support in getting into ranked lobbies and customization this game is amazing",5
There is a problem: The default BR map is so big. You should land 200 players ar once in the map. The it should be more exciting and fun to play the game.,5
"Can you help me with something, I love the game and I would have rated 5 stars but if I update the game play store tells me can't update call of duty. I have done it over three times and I get the same thing ,so what's wrong here please I want continue playing it üò≠ üò©",3
"Very fun and accurate game. Love playing every night with my friends, it glitches sometimes but doesn't bother me a whole lot. AWESOME GAME!!!!",5
Codm is the best online shooting game ever iv been playing over a year everything is great but the tropical season costs to much of data üòì can you reduce the size of the update ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè please it's a great game I and I want to play it but the update is to much and my dad is saying I must delete the game üò≠ so please reduce the update size good luck to the devs and the people,5
Love the game always have but now on mobile awesome you know I really love the game but there's a lot of bugs to get kicked off and lose points got to start all over again what's the point I bet if you paid money though you wouldn't get kicked off,1
The graphics of the game and the gameplay is pretty smooth but the only issue i have with this game is whenever i want to play it is always updating in the game and it takes like 5 minutes just to get into a game because of all the updates but overall i the game is nice,5
The game is good but the custom hud needs improvement. We can't increase the size of buttons after a certain point which is small.,4
Keeps crashing. I can play one match after that when I join another screen goes black and I should play with the music it seems.,1
Horrible. Multiple glitches and a very very bad interface. Only thing working smoothly is the paid content. I just deleted the game for the same reason.,4
Great game but keep blacking out the screen during a game have to restart game I spent 80 doller just to get at least a legendary gun but still can't get it it cost to much just to get all the draw,3
This game went from 5 star to 1. For some reason whenever I play battle Royale I'm always playing fake bots and not actual people. Which makes the game stupidly easy. I can't even let the fake bots kill me in a game. Not sure what is going on but it makes the game unplayable.,1
This is a really good game but when I try to install it it won't work and it so glitch man why can you not make this game more like not that glitch and it takes so long to get in the game when you install it and can you make no hacker's in the game coz I try shooting them and there are hacking and when that hack they go into my account and its annoying you need to make this game more safer and more less glitches.,1
My favourite Game but one problem i dont have max graphics in audio and graphics settings. Its showing this is not available in low graphics pls fix it!!!,5
"The game is great, but the 10 years of bann is unacceptable, activisin have to change that because only known players can get unbanned quickly but how about the other players that are not known, I mean come on, make it fair for other players too. I played this game for a very long time and just got banned for no reason, so please do something about the bann, it's really frustrating.",2
I just absolutely love this game...they can do some stuff better with some of the lagging issues but it's always changing and adding more stuff and I always can't wait for what happens next...anybody who hates this game is just a Karen or they need better devices,5
"For some reason the game won't update. After reaching at exactly 100% it just stops. Doesn't progress or reset. Due to this, I am not able to update to the latest version.",1
I love this game i was wating for this game release i am playing from first day i like this game so much must play game. I cannot give this game a 5 star rating because its lack of attention on the playerbase and also lack of balance in the whole game. Guy's don't get me wrong this game has the best multiplayer in mobile gaming platform but to be the best this game need attention to improveing the things that it has a problem with üëç,4
I had an amazing experience. There are multiple terrain options. There many different modes under the three main ones.,5
My favourite mobile game at the moment I love it way better the pubg for sure I buy bettle pass every season finished all 50 tires on battle pass first time since I started playing CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON AND THE NEXT BATTLE PASS Activision could you please make the draw going a little longer mainly the legendary draws 2 weeks is not long enough could you make then go for 3 weeks the mithycal are a perfect time witch is 1 month or at least make them a little cheaper?,5
Awesome game I have played it ever since it came out and I got to say please bring back zombies!!!!! ........That's not what I meant üòï new zombies game mode sucks sooooooo bad even with all the glitches the original mode was way better,5
"I have a Galaxy S10Plus, I tell u this is the BEST stress relief game on mobile. It's a game that requires me to play connect to wifi and well worth it. I started playing thus when it was only available on P.C. when it 1st came out. Lol",5
Call of Duty's game play and graphics are definitely 5 star. A few ups and downs throughout time but for the most part CoD has and probably will always be the best fps shooter of all time... console and mobile.,5
"The matchmaking algorithm is horrible I get one game of noobs then next game I get a lobby full of sweats and what's even worse if that there all on the other team, I'm left with the noobs and get destroyed. But overall good game.",4
Imagine using so much data to update after each update is being released... This is to much... Nice job on working on the controller issue... You really need to address the issue of updating.,3
Taking two stars back because of a massive bug. Internet speed is fast but game is like having no net. Lost various of matches due to it.,3
Good with a few bugs. Every now and then my screen will freeze or go black and I have to restart the entire game.,5
Takes too much device space when skins and other additional downloades are made in game . Shall not take more than 5gb when all in game downloades are carried out . Developers shall seriously think about it . This game is made for mobile not for PC that it takes more than 15gb space .,3
Great game. Definitely expensive if u want the kool weapons / items. But u can easily play for free and do great. Right now stuck at 100% for next expansion but won't let me play game,4
"Dear sir/madam, as just a regular player who doesnt have a good internet, and suffers with low end phone, i wanted to tell you something, may your game die and the new cod warzone comes above it, i have suffered by many annoying players and i am just tired of it, i even once in my life time broke my phone, it sucks for me to say this since i wasted alot on this once used to be a fun game to garbage game, thanks alot!!!",2
"MASSIVE APP WARNING 13GB+ make sure you have a quality device to play without much lag. You'll need a lot of space on your device to play. Festering with ads and microtransactions. Hackers are less abundant, but still around. SMGs are broken as always. Great game though.",4
"Very worst game now day's,I'm play since it's launch,but now I'm facing didn't connect to server,I'm not able to boot up game with my fiber wifi,i have to switch on data to login game but ping is high with data and wifi is working fine in other games like bgmi with 20ms i don't know what happening with game I'm not able to connect game after 5 or 10 min wait facing same error mssg please check Network,i will suggest you to check your game then ask ppls to check Network,i know you can't help.",1
"In 2020 I made this post about the game ""You literally can't play against other humans. So its technically not an online multiplayer."" And 2 years later it's alot worse. So I was in zone 871 around 7:35 in the morning central time when I realized that all of my matches were being played in the map Shipment and this one specific guy named ""DUI"" was able to put himself in each of my matches and targeted me each time I respawned. I told him stop harassing and ""u left me no option""",1
This is the best game ive ever played im givin it four stars as iam deducting one star for all the toxic things which rage many people. Over all its a great game. I only have prob with meta guns with super fast ttk and i only play tdm so i dont have the problem of persi.....but yea high ttk or damage guns(skilless) guns should be either nerfed or removed or else the game wont thrive much as it used to........,4
"What an exceptional game , very nice graphic design is spectacular indeed this is a legendary game. But please u guys should work on the network service I think some players are using cheat code or something pls rectify it , more over d update is very spacious indeed yet after the update the will still be lagging as am typing my preview now and am also updating and it's really taking time to update pls look into this little stuff pls abeg. Thanks but this game is just awesome üòéüòéüòé",5
I used to use a Huawei y9 2019... Its automatically on low graphics and it still looked good and played okay. Now I use a Samsung Galaxy A71. But it has optimization issues. Overheats atimes. Please fix this,3
"The Game Graphics is the outstanding part and the Guns here in this game specially Sniper is the best gun from my pov..sum guns like Kilo141, Cbr etc r always becoming the meta of every season and we suffer..This is the point that I notice when playing n codm should give all the guns an opportunity of becoming meta n that will be a great thing..This Is My POV it depends on the others what they think üôÇüëçüèª",4
"Its just exceptional gameüëåI mean the only reason it's still contending with PUBG is because PUBG came out first and has more players, I can't stop playing the game until these mfü§¨ updates they're killing my phone before I could play cod for over an hour and everything will be alright but now just for 10 mins and it starts lagging,overheating once start the game and see an opponent it's bye bye good Internet but that won't stop me from giving them the 5 stars 5hey deserve üòÅ",5
"Love this, it's free and awesome. did I mention free. I sync my ps4 controller up to my phone and go! Got to tweak the sensitivity a little. Then we're off.",5
This game is very good for who has high end device and laggy for low end device players . BUT I am playing game from season 2 og and i have a very good experience playing this game . This game has very best multiplayer mode and i have enjoyed this game . If you are new to this game you don't like that much but we you start grinding in ranked you definaltely like it .,5
Updated my review from 3 star to 5 star .. Bcoz... Its all about high end device... High end games need high end device.. To get all things goes smoothly... Thats the main things of this game... Now i can play everyrhing on max setting inclding extra graphics options on 60 fps smoothly.... I recently bought a gaming phn thats why üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,5
There is too much laging this game at some time I request to authority to keep maintain this lagin . I have a good network but this game show red singal I don't know why . And after sometime of play show connecting to server . I am totally upset please resolve this as soon as possible thanks u .,1
"Other then melee abusers there isn't much of a problem with the game Its just good, if y'all could reduce the aim assist and range on melee weapons then that would be fantastic.(Edit 01/05/2022) Y'all need weapon restrictions in ranked.",5
"This is an absolutely brilliant game I love it one of my favorites but the reason for the 4 stars is because I think we need more map updates/newer maps more frequently, also a small campaign maybe would be pretty cool üòé",4
Am calling on the developers to please bring the graphic quality back to normal I remember when I could play the game smoothly on 2gb ram phones but now it's just a pain pleaseiyou read this try to make the graphics a whole lot better for low end devices please the game overall is awesome but being unable to see a player from a certain distance leaves you at a disadvantage,5
"Everything is cool, the game needs to encourage distance combat, AND FIX THE SILLY SCOPES, no one want to look down a scope and see a big square in the middle.",5
"I love the game but it's been telling me to update for days now and I can't perfom some necessary action without updating. I just updated it to season 5 some minutes ago. When I was done downloading, it's saying ""can't install cod""üò°",1
Great but would be cool to add some touch button on the screen to switch from auto aim to manual aim. Or give it the ability to shoot enemy cars in auto aim.,4
"Awesome Game with cool graphics, modes etc BUT it doesn't work when connected to Wifi, please tell me how to fix this or fix this ASAP.",1
"I really really luv playing the game it helps me bond with my fam, but issues I'm having is the fact that I showed proof of a lot of CP packages I didn't order or receive I did order a $99.99 package I was double charged for but did not receive the second package there was a drawing called Artillery or Armory drawing that was a link out of the special offer lucky draw feature it was an awesome I drew a legendary Hopper R9 of it and drew the all the Crown of Kings bundle that's gone S.O.S plz",4
"Android, iphone, tablet, any tech i have the game still lag like crazy and i play on mute cause i cant listen to the game and lots of virus on my phone and you guys need to do something. You guys dont care and lost another player. Thanks for messing up a good game.",1
"Excellent üëå Awesome Game, Well Made, Great Graphics, easy Game Play, Fun and Addictive to Play for Hours! Just better have a good device with plenty of Gigs to spare because everytime they update the game their adding Gigs more each time.",5
I have been this game for a while now and it is really good. Not gonna lie tho I wish that the in game graphics could be better via character and weapon wise. Other than that its really addicting. Definitely recommend,5
"Even with stable and around 40-50 mbps connection it doesn't get loaded most of the times, it says can't connect to server please connect to Internet. Earlier i rated it 5 star, it was seamlessly working back then but now it sucks.",1
"An amazing game, but in-game support is very very very poor, too much bugs and all they ask for are screenshots from the settings instead of sorting the real problem",5
Sorry but 3 stars are enough..The most time and money wasting game ever existed..Lol idk why it says connecting to server while u have a nasa wifi. Activision is so bad nowadays üò™..this isn't the only issue the update(game data) consume a lot of space most of them aren't thag necessary..well i hope codm will lower the update gb(mb).,3
The maps bring back so many memories and the mobile controls work really well. It's awesome and so much fun to play!,5
"Totally awesome loved this game. thoroughly loved playing and grinding in it. Although I would say that codm really should listen to the communities to nerf and buff certain things because at the end of the day the players are what make the playerbase and not the developers. I hope to see more cooperation with players and developers in the future. But at the end of the day it is ""just a game"" so let's enjoy itüòÇüòÅüòÅ",5
"I liked this game very much. God, the graphics are great. The gameplay is also great. Thanks to Activision for making this game for us and one more thing to make Gun Attachments 6 great.",5
"I played this game from 3 years ago,but now. that game's including many cheaters & the BR matching system was so stupid they always be matching with high ping difference countries.If you have any way or any plan for fixed that issue then will be worth to get 5 stars rating",2
I am so addicted to this game but the only problem I have or complaint is when I am playing it crashes alot and I have alot of memory space and it's all updated. I hate it cuz I will be playing hella gud and bam it closes. üò° Other than that it's hella fun.,4
"Really good time filler especially in todays unusual situation. Good gameplay, interesting range of games. Over time I've got to grips with battle royale and I'm enjoying playing against other people. All good.",4
"Sadly, game keep shutting off randomly, no error, just exited the game. It's sad, because game is fun and runs smoothly on my phone :( EDIT: I'm playing almost month now, game is running great, many hours wasted in :D",1
"I love the game,no one should be saying the updates for cod is too much because the creators tried everything they could to compress the game from consoles to give opportunity to those without consoles to play and have a little experience about the game but the updates are quite large in space but thank you Activision ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
Still no contact from Activision. Have recovered profile myself. Back in the game now. No thanks to them.!!! Those four stars are for the game itself. If i had to rate the customer service it would be zero.,4
"Best mobile shooting game but the problem is every good stuff is just available in cp(which requires real money), shift at least some good items in creditstore or make it available by grinding.",3
This game is very nice. very fast to mobile and iliked This game. and HD game I give you 5 star becuse i like this game and i play this game. The place of the phone is very full and what should I do. You must be new update You must reduce its MB so we can play.,5
"I've been playing since it released, I love it and play every day, 1 thing please make alcatraz permanent, at this point the numbers speak for itself and since rebirth is permanent on warzone it only makes sense .keep up the great work.",5
"This is waste game of all time Because every month it ask update more than 1.5gb, every time when I update, it shows 100% in update, but it still download. But it wasn't update successfully. Minimum 6gb waste for updating. So i hate this game",1
"Norms, this is a total blast... THE BOMB üí£üí£ or as my friend would say... 'madt' üòÇ Only problem is I got really depressed after being logged out again from my account linked with my Facebook, and this time I couldn't login back as every effort to do so proved futile. But, due to my love for COD, I've opened a COD account with my email... and started afresh üíîü•≤ But it's all good For the love of COD ‚úäüèæüî•",5
"I couldn't play Call of Duty on my PC because my PC only has 4 gigs of ram and an a Intel Core i3 9th gen. Then suddenly I realised that with the help of bluestacks, I can actually run COD Mobile version on my PC and caan play COD on my PC now.. Kudos, developers!",5
"This game is fire and I love how it brings back the OG maps and it has balenced guns, but the down fall is that when you go to auto reload it does not reload while aiming.",5
This game only supports playstation controllers. Don't bother downloading until they support all bluetooth. I spent too much money on this for them not to support more than just one type of controller.,4
"This is the best mobile game ever, but the problem is the size of the application and its files it takes around 10 gb to play a good game so it the devs can decrease the size of the game then it may be useful for the low device players.",3
Please this last update with the sandstorm is unplayable on my phone.. it lags so much that even a bot could kill me. Please I beg you. Revert to a much stable version. I really enjoy this COD but right now it's unplayable.,1
"After the persistence nerf in s5, I guess there wont be much problem in multi-player. Now the time is to optimize Br devs. Why I prefer mp over br is lag, and boredom. After the addition of jackal fighters, br will be interesting, but lag exists which will make playing br quite hard. A nerf u guys can do is to nerf trip mine. Idea: A new mode, Air combat. Where you can fight with each other using jackal fighter. All the best devs. We, the community, believe in you.",4
"This is an amazing game for mobile. Takes me back to the old school COD BO same maps like Nuketown, Summit, Slums, Standoff and much more. Graphics are amazing as well including the weapons, classes etc Spray915",5
Excellent game i personally like it the reason why am I giving 4 stars is because your working hard on game but not on optimization it causes my phone heat battery down and fps issue hope you look into this matter and pls bring zombie mode classic soon as possible because i mainly played battle royale one (not og),4
"I'm a disabled veteran, got alot of empty time. This game is absolutely spot on, at times have to put it down cause it Transport you into the game. I love it.",5
"This is an awesome game ever üíùüòç I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Game is great yet the primary issue each one left this game one day is his size before update its around in excess of 16 GB , after update it will be 18 GB how can this be to store this game on mobile, developers why u all are not taking care of on this tremendous problem why all are you making for us challenging to utilize codm. In the event that this issue not settle you compel us to move different choices like Apex legend and so forth",3
"Please give us classic round based Zombies with the Cold War system such as the perk upgrades, weapon upgrades, pack a punch with AATs, etc... Hopefully Zombies comes back in some shape or form. Also PLEASE nerf PRESISTANCE or at least take it out of RankedüòÇ",3
"Hi guys this is the best game I have ever seen . In this game there alots of different modes ,ranking system, legendary skins and importantly there camos . The camos which tells the player how good your . My recommendation for the best gun in sniper cuz it's the all-rounder in the game and lots of free gifts it's a f2p and p2w game best thing bp (Battel pass ) you can get your cp back for the another bp üòâ this is the best game",5
Great game all around. Only thing I have to cry about is the chances of getting the legendary guns is impossible basically. Other then that I play every day and love the game with my Xbox controller,5
"Often facing the issue like reconnecting to the game, in the app the signal bar keeps spinning even though having good connection.. Please fix this ASAP...!!",4
This game is amazing with many features but please nerf the K9 Unit because I can never know when it's coming because when it spawns you can barely hear the whistle over the gunshots and when I check the map the dog icon is glitched but I'm pretty sure the icon part is just me but please nerf dog to make its spawning more known and make it bark if it's running across the map,4
"The game is good but it is really disgusting to get killed with just one hit of boxing gloves, k9 and 9stick . It's better to remove these features. #multplayer",4
"Best mobile game with loads of updates. You got to try it. But now with this updates my phone laggs and I have FRAME drops when I shoot and sometimes when I move aroun. Also when grenades explode, cars explode.... EDIT: SEAEON 4 HAS LITTLE TO NO LAG KN SAME PHONE",5
The game is very good but it will be more fantastic if have more map in BR and on game size When new update drop the size go up thats not good for players who plays on low storage device fix that !!!,5
I LOVE THIS GAME and I love the new update and everything about it but I need to tell you that the audio in multi-player and battle royal are laggy and it sounds weird I hope this gets to you soon so you can fix the problem but this game is the best and I can't wait to see the new event but when I update the game it doesn't update.,5
"I've played this game over and over but one thing keeps me from keeping it installed: controller support. I'd love to play this game with my 8bitdo Pro2, but the game won't let me use it.",4
Great Port. Very competitive and enjoyable. desync has improved but still varies greatly depending on matchmaking.,4
"Tired now. Frequently getting 200ms. Can't even enjoy normal match properly. Hope you guys fix it or gonna have to look for other games. What's point of giving all this maps/skins. But not fixing ping/server issue. Hate to say this...""Awesome game gone wrong"".",1
I'm just loving and loving this game more especially since they decided to bring back a new and improved zombies mode. Love you Activision and please continue to deliver awesome content in the future.. :),5
"It used to be fun, but with this much of laggs, bugs and more important cheaters in this, it's just a big disappointment. Also why we have to download maps every time that an update released???",2
Older phones don't work well playing this game as the game glitches and lags but with a newer phone that is fast this game is really fun and addicting The only downfall which I hate is the game updates probably once a week and you have to have enough space on your phone,5
Ill give this 3 stars for three reasons. Reason 1 this game needs constant updating. Reason 2 without any money you gets the most bad guns or anything else. Reason 3 lagging and glitching and hackers. I like this game but those are three reasons why i dont.,3
"The Helpshift customer support that CODM uses is awful, I cant contact anyone for help. The customer support chat is powered by a 3rd party service called ""Helpshift"" and the associate in the chat (named Gowtham S) is wasting hours of my time by taking 20 minutes to type each message and none of them were helpful",1
Full looot scheme for purchasing weapons. Strongly recommend not buying anything Guns and skins look cheap but you end up paying 5-6 times more than what you see.,1
Very Very nice game I loved it and I love attack of undead the most. And very good graphics according to me this game is just wonderful because there many random modes and maps and the best thing is that you can play with your friends in any way like private or public or battle royal or rank match and in rank match I don't why did they add grand Master only master was best but in anyway grand Master makes people more best because if you are legendary then just 5 more stage and then more best,5
"Uh hey there Activision . after the new season 5 update am not able to update my game, whenever after my whole game updates it shows to update again. I have been playing this game for so long please help me out with this problem..",4
Really great game just really mad I just spent more than 15$ on the battle pass someone deleted it and usually it keeps all my data whether I am signed in or not and I was not because it wasn't letting me sign up for some reason and know I have to restart the game also can you please add more WW2 guns specifically the m1a1 Thompson also my name is I.suck6789 please help I don't want restart the entire game,5
"I love the game graphics are real good, maps were furnished to optimum levels and vehicles were literally crazy and vast amount of customisation to all the gear ... I love this game‚ù§Ô∏è",5
I am playing COD since more than year. I got everything is fine on this game but one thing is nonsense and is Updating the game. why you update the game again and again very recently. I got mentally harassment by updating the game..so i don't want to play this game again.,1
"This game is all about extracting our money. Each update requires data and most of the weapons are not realistic hence why it's just a video game. It's ok as just a video game and that's it, it doesn't make the best player a better person than the next",3
"I have more than 10gb storage left but after season 4 update i can't play it it's showing insufficient storage plz free some and retry, i wasted my 3 gb data in 4/5 days. So my review changed, it's the worst game i ever played",1
I've been experiencing issues with my games graphics the past week. It's blur and lags the game so much that BR has become unplayable.,1
Thank you helps me destress even if I lose. Better free skins would be nice but happy with everything else. A special thanks to those that buy skins cause not all of us can afford it. Thanks to the devs that keep this game up an running .,5
I'm concerned with your finance direction. Battle pass is too expensive even with the discount & I've noticed you've gotten rid of the bundles. You best get a grip or competition will win out.,5
This Game is very nice and good to play in your free time. But most of the items n the games are paid using credits that are converted from actual money thefore limiting the free playing users. Also the are many tryhards and toxic players that don't allow us normal people to enjoy it,4
Why do the game quit every single time I played I've tried all I can but it still lagg and stop when am in the middle of a game. I have 3gb ram and 32gb of space so I don't know what is wrong pls fix this problem cause am not the only one facing this problem.üò©,4
Could you please not deduct rank points like a maniac. Just check why the player has left. Even if there is a small connection problem you just deduct a huge number of rank points. Dont you know how hard it is to increase them and you just dont care. Solve this problem asap or there is a curse coming towards you.,4
I've been a cod player starting back in o8 on Xbox. Life got busy time wasn't available as much. I picked it back up in 19 graphics and game play has only improved.,5
"It's been really sucky I be in a ranked match and it closes itself so I'm penalized, plus I'm shoosting but nothing happens. Please fix the bugs. love the game tho",5
Good graphics. But The UI is too congested or cluttered. Apart from that lots of game mode and battle arenas to play,5
"It's a great game but I get put in matches with people that are level 150 and I'm only level 50 and that makes it quite hard to win a match, but most of all very fun and enjoyable",3
Overall a great game been playing it since season 1 But please increase the number of participants in BR to 150 at least and slow down that BR electric safe zone marker Slow it down to the speed of the gas in Warzone it's too fast for players if you don't have a vehicle you die. Or maybe change it to gas and add gas masks like in warzone,5
"I feel like its now a better game it used to be, since the abomination of the year 2021 with unfinished games like cod vanguard, battlefield 2042 and halo infinite have lack of content and no potential at all and having things the fans do not want, cod mobile is my choice, i now enjoy cod mobile and warzone mobile for their potential.",5
Best shooting game better than fortnite and pubg and when I played I found out that there was a battle with a bunch of players and then I joined and saw it was br (battle royale) with ranked match and multiplayer overall the best mobile game of 2022 (so far) but add some food to heal health and add superheros,5
Since the update I am unable to connect through wifi. Uninstalled and redownloaded 3 times and still won't connect. Glad I never spent any $$.,4
"Unreal totally.. AND SO MEANY BUGS! Game is installed every two to tree weeks from beginning. They say update Yes 1.6 GB ewery 2-3 weaks Lame!!! And it downloads same maps skins and weapons every time after ""update"" again some 3GB sick!!!",1
"First to begin with its a great game and all deserves the 5 star but there i some complaints from my side. Unbalanced weapons, unbalanced ranked matchmaking, persistence abusing like all those stuff makes u mad at the game so if u could look deeper into that it would mean alot but futher than that a great game thank u call of dutyüòúü§ô",5
"Best shooter multiplayer game on phones, Both Multiplayer and battle royal modes in one game, awesome I didn't like battle royal games but this awesome game really changed my opinion.now I'm really excited to try warzone as well.",5
Your drops are a rip off constantly have to redownload everything after each update an there's to many other countries dumped in one server I'll never ever spend a dollar on another Activision product or anything y'all are involved in ever again an if another player is reading this trust me just find a different game but whatever you do don't drop money on this ripoff they don't even give people a chance to get legendary or mythical skins for free through events üñïüëé‚úåÔ∏è,1
This is the best game I could ever ask for I always win the game and no sticking it only stick once when the net work was giving trouble but other wise its really a fun game like I have gun and other cool stuff I could use and like I said I always win in this game I only lose once but people who seeing this please please please get this really fun game I know what I telling u guys now...üòÄ woah and cool other friends and stuff u know yeahüòÄ That's why pepople should download this call of duty.üòÅ,5
This game used to be good but now it sucks üòî full of bugs campers cheaters ect... It's so unfair üò≠ For example I was playing ranked and the enemies had like 12 ranks more than me.. so I decided to leave the match cuz it had NO POINT OF PLAYING and guess what? I GOT FRICKIN BANNED HOLY F..,2
It is great I just wish it was eiser to find a round in ranked. Also you can only put 5 atachments on a gun. I wish you can put one item from every catagory.,4
"I have been playing CoD for 2 years now, it was really good before the current season but now in this season the game lags so hard I cannot even see what's going on, I do play on a high end phone but still it lags so much.One can't see what's even happening. Pls üôè Fix this.",5
The size of the game pls ....it is getting larger and larger....pls help us find something to do to it our able developers... This mb we used to update it will also add with the space season 4 has carried ...it is not supposed to be so....abeg help us oooo...,4
Great game. The only downside is the guns are to expensive fora poor man like me. I can not afford to buy anything. So i am stuck with the default skin but that is OK.,4
"Damnnnn!!!!, I love this game, I've been playing this game since last year......I haven't bought any Battle pass...but never the less.....I get to made friends overseas and other countries....... please keep on improving ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíñüíñüíñ this is the PNG codm",5
New modes.... Mission... And interesting matches must be added indian version map and more accurate graphics as the size is too much and also add more powers to list,1
"Overall it's a great game,not pay for win and matches are kinda fair and there are a lot of fun modes to choose from.",5
Best free gaming experience I have ever had. Great graphics! Always new things to conquer! Competition at its best.,5
Its a very good game but I liked it more if you'll can put a different mythical gun in the airdrop keep the attic and remove the holger and put something else like the m13 or some and also put epic shotgun in the events üòâ other then that I love the game üéÆ,5
I been playing this game for around 3 years and only recently it started freezing please fix the issue its been going on for months now. apart from that great game,3
Umm during a match I got a final kill but the weird part is during the last kill I don't know how or what tool or something was activated but I could see the enemy through a wall in a red outline and I'm saying I am not hacking and if that's a legit item I need it what is it's name lol.,5
I've been playing this mobile shooter game for long now and each update seems to get so much better!! A couple bugs but none that affects the game play; which is the best!!,5
A super good game good graphics but the only thing that I don't like is that sometimes it freezes and I check my connection/wifi ect and it's good and idk why it happens but ignoring the trouble the game is so good,4
Wish they didn't cross reference with other platforms. Hard to play mobile with someone who uses a game system. Also should not take me a whole clip to kill someone and they shoot me one time and I die.,3
"Graphics are so good , game was downloaded after so many issues , but if gives and update after some days and now same thing is happening with the update now i had update the game for 3 times but it is not updating , how much internet i had to waste , huh",3
"Have had lots of fun playing this game, I've regularly purchased bundles because it's a great way to get good skins without gambling, however the Devs seem to have taken that function away so now the only option to get skins is crates and draws which is gambling, I don't have spare money to gamble so unfortunately I'm going to have to reduce my rating and stop playing this game, I will not be forced to gamble my money and want nothing to do with a company that asks that of me, f you codm!",1
Do not download this game. The corruption and greed is almost as bad as politics. Was forced to give it 1 start for the ability to make this comment. Have since uninstalled and now feel much better.,1
Kids beware teens catching feels on the chats in this game and is very toxic. There mother's be ashamed. Ruin a good game for others. Other than that cool game to play love it. I'd rate more if developers kept a live eye on the chat rooms Also hate having to remove a lot of my apps to redownload guns and maps I already had. What's the point when I had all camos and maps installed already before having removed apps to update cod. ü§î,3
"It was great at first but now it crashes on me, every time I start a match I don't have a gun. It too many bugs, plus a lot of hacker's. It's not worth playing. I won't spend another dime. It sucks.",1
"the game isn't even about war anymore, its about mythical anime weapons and females in revealing clothing. maybe add some more realistic weapons? iconic weapons? maybe a BAR shotgun, actual mp40, just something real and not some demonsong whatever.",2
All round its a good game with solid gameplay but can y'all bring back the og zombie mode. It's better than the ones we've been getting. And also the call out for legendary rank playersüôáüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That would be awesome pls,5
"Deffinetly a good game but you need to fix for storage, codm takes up 22 gigs!!! and there are games that take up less and graphics are on par with codm at least make it less than 15 gigs because i just got this tab and storage is legit almost full, your game is good but fix the storage",3
"Damn awesome but must stop adding more resources,cause its annoying or you can't play the game,then it kicks you out so i give you now only one star and the freezing is annoying and i got a 8G ram",1
"I rate fully because there were no glithches , mobile hang, and these is have smooth control i like this game iam in level -110 and i love this game in this battle royal (BR) so realistic graphics we land so fast and GUN costimisation is very goodüôÇüôÇüòÄüòÉ -- pranav ~~~~ IUD NAME - P1450 anyone finding my iud so writs on big letters. BUT i have to download so many maps of multiplayer or any features idont like this type i want 2-3 maps free downloaded please adjust this",5
"Good for camping snipers and aim bots, kill cams don't lie, lots of lag hacks, just terrible, top garbage, was a 5 star game before the first update or shall I say downdated everything, only thing good about the game is graphics, that's all, just to many modders and campers now, download for aim bot nation and hacker central",1
"Worse game ever...updates are the size of a mammoth.Please do something about the size of the game.Stop keeping old skins and stuff in the game,it is making the game too large and heavy for low speced devices.Instead imorove on the overall gameplay and animations(learn from bgmi).This is my humble opinion üòÄ",1
"I really like the game. However, after the last update the game sometimes freezes during play and my mobile phone heats up. Please fix it.",4
The game need huge optimistic -BR glitches/ servers /footsteps need to be more loud / the HUD need to be copyable from BR / BR need to be without BSA or just boost head shots in all snipers and marksman / nerf in all classes to give more adventage to skilled players / optimistic the vehicles( sounds /driving/ hit player / accident's/ explosion) / add training mode -Melee need to be less range or damage -scorestreaks need to be with CD (colddown) ( now just spamming them with percestince),4
I like it its just like all the other cods combined just one thing updates I just had one two days ago and now there's another. I wish there was a way to play with your ps4 or Xbox controller that would be awesome.,4
It is a amazing game because it has a lots of action and it's graphics are also good. It is the best multiplayer game I have ever played. If you like gunfight games you should at least play it once.üòÉüòÉ,5
Since the last update I am constantly getting app timed out and disconnecting it takes ages to load now and puts me in the game then as it's starting it says timed out and kicks me out the game need this fixed as play everyday until now and now can't use the app anymore,1
The game is all good no words only thing which destroys all the good in the game is that hell melee abusing and unbalanced meta guns..codm is tricky going behind money without balance for better experience buffing everygun with a legendary in a season and introducing new op guns which are the main reasons for players quitting codm every dayy..better codm change to fruit ninga;-),5
"I love this game, been playing it for year's, takes up heaps of space but its COD after all. Good game play, graphics isn't the best but for a mobile game, 100% good.",5
"I'm playing the game for 2 months now and this is the second time I can't log into the game. firts I used my Facebook account and I load everything, I used over 13gig for that wen. I wanted to login it says (error) I made a second account again I Used over 13gig with my Google account the same thing within 2 months come on call of duty what ball of nonsense is this.......",1
"Whats in the new update:More storage chewed, and pro tip: everyone going to be using gameloop and pc because developers arent thinking how much space this game chews, ranked maps, modes and weapons on top of operational skins. Money hungry and storage hungry. 2 for the price of one. Gotta love those odds. Still lots of cool unkillable glitches in game, please dont remove those or nerf turrets. I like how bots have aimbot and wallhack. Promoting cheating is key üòÇ",1
This is very beautiful and optimised game... I am also like this game there are many features and modes in this game but a problem is also I am faced that here's no tpp mp rank match.. please gives us tpp mp rank match then the game is properly fixed..,5
Why do you always have to redownload the resources you've previously downloaded when the update is out?? Also when updating the game it seems as if one is downloading the game again completely even if one has it already.,3
"the game is wonderful and amazing,but it needs more work on graphics and try to reduce the game's storage, that's all",5
This is an amazing game but the only problem with it is storage. I have not downloaded all files but it still takes 8gb. I hope Activision will look after it,4
Absolutely love it. However i wish the download queue was much faster rather than hours of downloading simple features. Seems to get better Wich updates however still so slow.,5
"It takes a lot of space, time, money, and control but Call of Duty Mobile is a great game/app. The extra Updates and data usage are worth it üíñüíãü§åüëå",5
I just downloaded the whole update and the app just asked me to download it all over again!! It's fun and incredible just wow this sucks üòï now I gotta wait twice as long and now I'm not gonna have the time to claim my rewards I've only got two days left not even to get 10 tiers all work no play from here.,4
An amazing game that never gets old. They now need to introduce a during-the-night battle royale where missions can be done using night visions and flares etc.,5
"It consumes too much data... update equally takes much too, game laggs especially in rank matches and br. I hope this game doesn't run like asphalt 8, very greedy and selfish game, many players left d game already. No changes, so annoying üò†.",2
"I absolutely hate how we have to update it so frequently.Why can't we play with someone who is updated but we aren't?The graphics and all is nice.Stop making us update,it takes too much storage and we have other things than playing games.",2
Great game but in the call of duty world championship I didn't to play stage 1 every time I tried it said check your network but it was fine and now its stage 2 and I am not qualified and probably not going to get back in is there a different way to get in?,3
"It's a very good game to play. There should be improvement of the server usage. Little break down of server affect the game so badly, I guess it's poor.",5
I gave this game a 5 star 2 years ago after playing it before that as well still playing love the game hate the hackers and people that camp but that's how they play I may get mad but not really cause it's just a game but I have also meet some great ppl that I now consider a real friends and some I have actually meet in person so got nothing but good things to say about this game,5
It is an amazing game. The graphics are more that expected! The reason it gets a four for me is because it is way to much storage On my phone. Download it.,4
It was my favourite game but not anymore everything is good on it but why? Okay 1st thr network ping always high and not stable and 2 nd most important lagging always and everything is okay but when i be on fight starting shooting lagg come with it you have to fixe this and if you know 33000 peoples were left the game this week more coming and we need DP weapon add it and most important there are people can buy mythic weapons and legendary who are more powerful so that not fair,1
"Hello, my account was attended twice and I do not know the reason why when the match ends, my account is attended to. I want to know the reason. I was playing on the PC and not on the phone, and there were some problems connecting to the Internet, but I got first place in the game. I only played once and my account was attended",1
Remove bots form mp and br...If we play ranked match then it means it should be competitive not boring..I wanted that battle royale graphic should be good as multiplayer match like tdm... Battle royale graphic sucks....Plz give more maps for battle royale like citys town nature a big map...and.. Others are great.,4
The character s are good the graphics are not bad I really enjoyed playing the game but it was really lagy. And it took a lot of time to download,5
I've loves this game from the day it came out amazing updates very frequently awesome and easy to use controls with an amazing interface for weaponry..keep up it up !!!,5
"Excellent gameplay been playing since release, i love it, no problem is the ability to connect a controller other than that 10 out of 10 game",5
I hate that everytime I have to update. I have just done a two 2gig update and in less than a week you are asking for a 1.5gig update again. What nonsense is this. This use to be a great game but I think you're losing us.,1
"Definitely the best mobile shooter game. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Excellent graphics, awesome gameplay although the game kinda eats up alot of my space but otherwise I rate CODM above any other mobile shooter games out there.",5
"It's a great game, but there is a bug that blacks my screen out sometimes mid game (in Battle Royale mode) and after MP matches.",5
I used to look up to you guys but you made the game so unfair the pay to win amount is insane the hackers are skyrocketing and everytime i played get matched with bots its been a year since i played this game and i think its trash its not the best it can be apex legends mobile is looking better than this so far im really sad activision cause i was a really good player i mean really good and i just kept getting matched with bots while i had the enemy team which has pros vs 4 bots 1 pro,1
"One of the best entertainment in 2021, graphics are better than other's. Server issues point me few times where i have a strong internet connection.",3
Its becoming ridiculous how much memory this game takes!!! Nearly 19GB in size for one game on a phone!!! I keep deleting all my films and videos for this ONE game!!! And im a paying customer soon im going to run out of space!!,3
"This game is fantastic in all mode but there is some issue in some of the toxic gun like war machine , purifier and in trap master this type of class and gun only give favour the player which have that gun and that toxic class this type of issue waste the all hard word of player who die with this toxicity please fix it",4
Great game but when you spin you get let down because it'll stay on the skin you want andove to a completely different one so you end up spend all of your cod points just for that one skin. Overall fun game.,5
Is there anyway you guys could add like a survival mode? Something like in call of duty modern warfare 3 Great game though. It's the first time I ever find myself playing games on my phone and this is the only one I have installed,5
You know what would be an amazing add on to this game is to have finishing move like in warzone. Apex legends has it and I think that cod being such an amazing mobile game lacks that one thing. Hope you hmguys can add on finishing moves to this game.,5
good game only thing is i wish they added classes like stealth for example they could go invis for 5 seconds with a 30 second cooldown and cant shoot or anything during it its just a sneak up or get out but i reccomend to anyone that likes fps games,5
"As usual, great game, best military br game out there, i recommend this if you love competition, but some of ypur updates come with bugs and lags, not much but it still affects gameplay sometimes",4
"This game is fun but recently started freezing ALOT. I've done everything from un and reinstalling, messing with the settings. Battle royale is the only one it happens on. So disappointing",5
I've updated s5 but the game won't start it keeps saying update and I've done that already I've had to cancel it 3 times and restart what's going on I really hate this fix this bug thank you,1
"It is a great game. I am already a pro in just a day. But there are too many loading screens, just because of that I am giving it 4 stars. But if there were less loading screens I would rate it 5 stars.",4
Awesome!!!! Great gaming experience for on the go players! Great graphics and design. Keep it up!,5
"A very well-rounded battle royale game but I complain of obe problem, The graphics force it to crash despite the ram of my phone (4gb) and it had become a real hassle to enjoy the game but I just feel like giving it 5 stars",5
"The game is great. The thing is, there are certain buttons in the MP and BR layout settings which are not supposed to be there because we don't really know what their uses are.",5
Was a Great game until newest updates began freezing and crashing while in the middle of matches! My comment probably won't matter but you it.,5
"Call of duty mobile is very fun with amazing graphics n quality for a mobile game, may take alot of storage and lower fps on low end devices but very copable n skill based ranked is fun and challenging. Game is amazing because devs listen to community I have no problems. Except the mac10 smg which is getting a nerfüî•",5
Like playing the real game perfect but better. More control on the android. They can't stop the MVP And on level 23.,5
"Best gaming experience on a Phone. However takes up far too much room, due to the unnessory & mandatory updates. These updates should be optional.",1
"I ""like"" this game but the amount of space it takes up 13GB, come on now & I have 32GB phone, So I suffer a ""LOT"" of lag when I play... but I hate y'all gameüëπ y'all really had to make the ""S3"" update 2.21GB...ü•≤ Edit: S5 & it's 1.51GB's I have no more storage plz stop making the updates Soo big...üò≠",3
It's a great game and I like it but its sometimes laggy and it wont sign in easily with middle east ip servers and try to give us better stuff in the challenges cuz most of the items are not that good,4
Its good but i wish they would add more stuff instead of just circus skins and stuff and also up the time and kill/score limits of the game modes like for example ffa is caped at only 20 kills so you cant even get a nuke unlike almost every other cod ever,3
"It's easy to play and very addictive. Ever since I made my switch from PUBG to Codm, I realized codm is greater than PUBG. Has a broad range of weapons for you to select from for the playing style you adopt.",5
Like the new update but it's a lot more laggy but its better with maxed sensitivity on everything except your sniper scopes. And since I don't use a controller I only have 94-4 score in Shipment 1944 instead of higher.,5
One issue is that it is hard to find my loadouts if they put a picture of the first gun you can get from that type like a picture of an LMG next to the LMG category. But either way great graphics and awesome guns. They put üíØ% into the game.,5
Love the game alot but the spawn killing is ruining it so bad like Jesus the spawn shield bearly last any time. The other team can just stay at your spawn around the corner and just stay there. Honestly this game gonna die fast if this keeps up,3
The game constantly crashes everytime I try to download a map or skin. Makes game almost unplayable.,1
Hello!!!!!! I'm finding it difficult to update the game. I've tried it 5 times. It gets to 100% and fails. I start over again the same thing. Do something about this new update üôÑüôÑüôÑ,1
At first I had so much fun then melee appeared and every time I want to play a noal game someone just starting to get toxic in the chat and getting sniped from the start of the game by a sweaty try hard I just had enough of the game before it was simple and enjoyable now it's just sweats and melee abusers I just play one game of search and destroy game every month or a couple of weeks just to remind my self that this game is trash,1
"Huge downer for African countries. Minimum ping 80-100ms,while other counties hav a max of about 40 ms. You always come second best in most gunfights because of the disadvantage of no African server, even though Africa has a huge Codm usage.",1
"The lobby seems to be laggy, and frequent frame drops can be observed. Bt in game fps is stable. Please try to fix the lag in lobby and other animations as well",5
"Every bit as impressive as console, has everything and is getting new things always. Mix up of old maps and old guns and new ones, too good !",5
I like this game alot just the blackout update I didn't like and I keep getting signed out and my passwords never work so I had to keep restarting but other than that it's pretty good a bit laggy and good.,3
That's a good game I recommend it for anyone to play it I've used a lot of game hours of my time playing this game please fix the bugs that are mentioned such as spawning with no weapon and lots of lagging thank you.,5
"I love this game, but once there is an update no matter how fast the wifi is it's keep on downloading for hours and hours and hours. I request please make the life easy for the players so, they can download easily and have enough space on their phone.",1
It is a very good game but after recent update this game is thrash always crashes after one match always after having high end device pls fix this issue or else i have delete it i have many choices like bgmi pls fix this issue,1
There are just unbelievable updates every few days it seems. Then again hours of map and resources download and phone space occupancy ... :(,3
"Its a fantastic game.. Though it has lagging issues, which is rare tho, n the audio needs to be worked on especially in BR mode.. The issues started about 2 updates ago",4
Literarily a PC game released in mobile version. Insane Game. Not Recommended for Low end devices. Best graphics that can be expected in a mobile game,5
"Im loving this, havent been able to stop playing. The updates are an issue, I know it's nice to have new seasons but maybe not as frequently.",3
This is the best game ever. even the graphics are really good but I just want one thing free . You should give 50 cp every week that's why I give it a 5 star. Becouse it is my favorite game keep it up guys,5
"The best gaming experience also it we can play for fun and also to earn from some platforms like yt, insta,glip etc. But 1 thing no one likes abt this game is sometimes this game is pay to win you guyz provide so many gun bluprints and other stuff which we can purchase only from money and the they are overpowered so if a normal no top up player and a gamer who does top up in game goes to do 1v1 or pvp they one who does top up will win just 1 thing no one likes.",4
I think yoy guys should make it more feely because there are many glitches and even by picking our favourite gun it chooses gun so if you will do these changes it will be a perfect game on other hand I am pretty sure it will be a successful game,2
When I try to download the game it says network error I tried to log in with my Facebook account and a guess it still won't let me do it I have Wi-Fi so I don't know what the issue can you please fix it please and thank you,2
I love the lmg's the best but they need a few upgrades and but most importantly the game will sometimes lag with people that has poor quality/connections keep up the good work cause I'm a call of duty fan im disappointed cause zombies are goneüëç,2
Galaxy s22 ultra unable to play after update I updated the game last night it works good all night but the. I haven't bem able to play all day clearance data and cache also unistall the game and download it 2 already and it would not load restart the game after each step as well,1
"Gameplay is good there is no doubt about it but when i updated the game i have to again download old maps,gun camo,vehical camos,all other camos and resources so i request the developer to fix it I am telling this because not every one has broadband service they to have download from mobile internet",4
"Hello The updating of this game is insane How can u tell the user to redownload the game all in the name of updating the game, ok I tried i updating the game now and it just started from beginning whrn I dont have enough data for the updating Wat kind of waste is this WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME NOW?????? THERE IS NO NETWORK AT ALLL IM TIRED OF BEING KILLED BY NOOBIES BECAUSE OF NETWORK SHOWING 200M/S EVERYTIME I ENTER THE GAME... I AM TIRED OF THIS ANNOYING SITUATION...GIVES ME ANGER ISSUES",1
Everything is fine but in previous season after Ninja class upgradation footsteps completely silent and now there some sound in ninja class after chip upgrade please fix these .. one more please remove the pump class it's very annoying...,5
"Hey developers team, I have an issue with this game. Whenever I try to open this game a dialogue box appears and says ""DOWNLOAD CONFIGURATION FAILED"" restart the game.",1
Over these one shot kill shotguns. Every man and his dog carries one. It is too easy to exploit and sucks the fun from the game. Change this nonsense or I'm out. Ridiculous,2
"You should make it where we can change the graphics to the higher one if we all ready chose the low graphics, and keep the controls you put last season",4
New Update is going wrong My 5gb data is wasted to update this version but it still going. Whats the matter i can't understand. I have tried three times but still now it is not done.. I am very disappointed,3
"It been coming increasingly annoying, Have trying updating it more than 3 times after download would say can't install, would just try my last move and if it still same then have no choice than to delete the game out of my phone",1
"Maybe I am being too critical, because I know it is just a game, but I think they are conditioning people to get themselves killed in real life. I re eall uh oh liked how they experimented wi to h the one or two shot kills, and getting penalized for killing your teammates. Really, how many times do you to early have to shoot someone in the face to kill them? And cutting in front of someone to steal their kill... Or running around with boxing gloves to kill people on a battlefield.",5
"I just love this game. But developer need to fix the lag issues in 10 vs 10 or 12 vs 12 matches. As the number of players increase, the lag also increases.",4
Issues with last update. It updates but doesn't allow me to start the game. Updated a few times with the same results. I have a Samsung S10.,1
"Great game, love the graphics and everything about this game is nust amazing, but when update roll around they take longer than how long it takes to find a cure for cancer, but seriourly other than that this game is perfect",4
"Thermite covers way to large of an area, can't run through it because it takes so much damage also lasts way too long, I may be trash but why do I gotta be getting ""swarmed"" ""chopper gunned"" ""airstriked"" EVERY SINGLE GAME! like hf can't do freaking anything cause I'm dying by God 5 times over, I don't belong in Legendary why tf am I there.",1
I am on a low end device and literally I am facing many issues like lag and also ping issues these issues are the major issues that the players with low end device like me facing very much. I only have a request to developers please fix it and if anyone read this and related as to you please support this,2
"I like this game but not more than pubg it is fully animated not realistic as well it has network issues Everytime while playing it shows connecting server , retry which is making me irritate",4
"Listen to me Activision , NEW UPDATE SUCKS BIG TIME , whoever suggested it might be having some issues in their life , dude make it worth playing , what is with this no attachment , useless health system , lagging and bots , also nerfed the ski and wingsuit , what the hell is wrong with your developers üòê , it was fine before the update , you guys made it fall",4
Currently getting booted mid game. Hence the reason for the 2 star rating. Please fix for 5 star review. Alone with the constant updates takes so much storage that I can barely have any other apps on phone,2
"Ranked matchmaking needs fixing Random teammates are worst always gives bot teammates need to be balanced teams for fair gameplay,Draws are absolute bullcrap if even something has an odds of 30% you might not still get it for spending less ,draws are rigged 100% so if you want something good you gotta buy it,Crates and Bundles have been garbage lately same skins getting rebundled it's only becoming a cash grab pay to win skins are becoming a thing now Very unfair.",4
Currently trying to update it for season 4 and the update stops after showing 100% and not getting completed.. 3rd time doing it... Seems like some issue with the update,4
"This an amzing time killer, and fun to play. It works good and has great graphics, it is the just about the only game I play.",5
"Becoming worst. Every update you have to download all maps, weapon cameos etc. Worst of all is the game now occupying 7 to 8gb of space. Too much for a mobile game. It should not be called COD: Mobile.",1
"Same issue, 2 gamers on the same network we both get timeout. Hope with the new version update it is cleared up. Great game!!",5
"Hey, this review is a request to the cod that please bring back the mode of multiplayer zombie mode I am playing this game since 4 years. In my experience it is the best mode ever.",5
"I havent played the game in a long time and when i tried to play the game again i couldnt sign in to my old account because of an update meaning that i lost EVERYTHING i had. I couldnt even retreive my account, so f you activision.",1
This Game was great but now the update is out I couldn't update it so I have to delete it due to increased storage (1.53GB) I don't want to delete it but due to updat I have to delete it codm team if u all reduce the side to 1.50 for download and update both the I will fell very good,3
"Great game it's fun / exciting and full of cool gadgets, weapons and gear to customize from. The lagging problem had been fixed witch is good üëç, still their are hackers and cheaters.",5
"It's best game so far on playstore with realistic graphics and smooth gameplay , it has a lot of content and all fun to use , everyone should try this out",5
"Changed from 5 stars. This game is trash, no balance in any aspect. A f..king pay to win, only for those who waste money on this game.. lots of lag, desync, bad user experience, not enjoyable at all. Wastage of money and time both. My suggestion is don't even install this f..king game, its lame.. Enemy with a paid gun, oh no matter what you do, you can't win.. that is shame CODM.",1
"I have played many battle royale games before this game, but honestly, this is the most beautiful and most enjoyable and the most beautiful thing about it is the graphics and its quality, without a doubt, there is no competitor for this game.",5
"Good handling with the screen, I want to play with my controller but it lags with the controls, it isnt as crisp as it could be",5
"I want my old cod mobile account back, I've been trying to get into it and I can't for some reason.. I linked my Facebook and Google, im trying to get back into my main account not some new starter account. What's the point of me having the game if I lost all of my damn progress...",3
Having problems with this current update. This is the 5th time im download and when it reaches 99 it ends and starts all over again.,2
The best game out there.I have been playing this game since 2019 its pretty fun graphics are nice the skins too and the cost for some of the cd are not too much unlike other games i highly suggest it it is an outstanding game,5
"Been playing for about a year now and love it. A few minor glitches and stuff ups occasionally, but not enough to not want to play it anymore.",5
"Better on a newer phone. But now, why all the hackers! This game used to be fun when I wasn't getting killed by hackers every spawn. I know I'm not the only one to go through this but there needs to be a way to stop hackers. I try to turn them in but Why can't your team detect hackers before they even get into a match. It's not fair that some of us learn how to play and others can just hack cause they suck at the game. Please fix this I don't wanna change games just yet. Apex legends is out now",3
The game is overall great. But this of every month having to update the version and being almost 2GB plus additional downloads on the app itself is ridiculous man. So I'll give 4 Stars,4
A refined multiplayer battle experience. The battle royale mode could be better but then no complaints since the gaming experience especially the weapons make you feel right in the action...,5
The large constant updates on mobile translates to too many long wait times before you can spend some down time to play a match or two before you need to get back to whatever you do when not waiting on COD mobile to download and install another update.,3
"I can't believe this is a mobile game!!!! It is amazing! Best COD made on any platform. Takes a bit to get used to the controls, but an amazing game!",5
Season 5 update doesn't istall !!! I uad donw it by almost 4 times but it didn't install .... it's stuck on 100% ...... The game is awesome by the way but this season 5...???!!!!!!!,3
"Great game, love to see a way to work for the bp like getting to tier 50 then you start the bp over again but its all unlocked. Thatd be a way to earn a modest amount of cod points aswell so it'd be better for free to players. (I am for the most part one)",5
The game is quite good but I do have one complain here... I had an account previously @kt__23__ I never used any bots/hacks/mods to play games (else what is even the meaning of playing then) and I got banned. First for a short periods and then finally for 10years... I wrote emails... Tried to contact ppl... No response ever received at any stage. They probably only reply when there's issue with payments or something... But I'm a developer too and I expect my users to report any kind of issue.,3
Needs to crashing!!! I'm losing Ranked Match XP because the screen blacks out and i can't participate in the match sometimes! Fix ASAP!!!!!,3
"Good but please Fix your server . Even I have 5G network I lost connection, only way to play this is my own wifi. When ever I'm not home and I want play this I lost connection, please respond and fix this soon",3
I would like this game if it wasnt so laggy also i downloaded the hd graphics but it didnt work and I went to settings but most of the setting i cant even change its a good game most of it doesint work,1
I have donwloaded many time the latest version of session 4 but when the download is completed. The downloaded game cannot be installed. But meanwhile This game is awesome.,4
"5/31/2022 *Will NOT let me update! There's plenty of space on my phone. Gets to 100% and won't complete! Please fix if you want your 5 stars back because I've blown enough money on this damn game, it should work properly!",1
"I love this Game ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê . The graphics quality is excellent., Battle Royal map is so good and very big. Also there is a various type of MP maps which is so nice . Thank call of duty üí´",5
"This is great, everything of the game is great but very very addictive, everything is set in to place, like if u haven't downloaded this then I don't know what your waiting for but just download it right now! I'M TOTALLY SPEECHLESS üòÅ",5
This game is so cool best graphic then free fire & I love call of duty games like black oop modem war etc...... Good gameplay also I post the gameplay video in my YouTube channel easy to use control. Life is a game enjoy....!! Call of duty Mobile,5
"Bots bots and bots. There is no challenge, all you do is shoot at some less than competent beings. How can it be fun to 'win' ten solo battle royales in a row and tens and tens of matches? (All ranked). Do something about big skill gaps and redicelous anti-rage measures..",1
"Training as you know is very important, especially ,if you kill for living, this game push you in a easy way to progress and developing some skills, just focus on your next target, just kill, or be killed you choose #442#,#5111#üòâ",5
Good game! Game has a lot of bums right now. Boxing gloves are instant kill but bullets aren't. Melee has taken over the game. Much less of a shooter now.,3
I love this game it has brought me joy but i can only use it at home being a online game i think that they should make a offline game like this one so people can play on the goüé† but call of duty takes a lot of space,4
It's actually a great pass time now if I could combine the gyro control with controller and put the screen in vr mode then it would honestly be over for all the other players,5
"Very bad ! It always show network error even though I have a highs speed network,it won't enter the game . It is worst nowadays.",1
I would like a 44. Magnum added in the style of one of Call Of Duty's most famous villains. Please make the 44. Magnum the same style as the one used by General Shepherd in Modern Warfare 2. üëå,5
"Best battle royal on mobile so far (in my opinion) but I have one problem, I'm playing on a Galaxy Tab A and I'm having lag issues and my graphics are kind of laggy. Otherwise this is a very good game;)",4
"Not able to install new season on my Oneplus 8T, although previous seasons was working fine. The PlayStore crashed when download reaches 100.",2
"Best fps i have played thus far. I love the realistic gameplay, some fps lack that aspect which is what makes codm supreme and it works perfectly on my 2GB RAM phone, i hope the new update has no bugs",5
"Amazing game. I love the graphics and everything, but WAY too much storage is needed. I mean, why do you have a 2 gb update every other month?",4
Fantastic game you don't have to spend money to play but can. Awesome 3rd and 1st person royal matches a long with awesome ranked and non ranked pvp love this game wish I got a little more lucky on the special draws but still worth playing and downloading,5
"Too many hackers.. Auto aim to the fullest. Fire rate unbalance, damage doesn't match to the gun. That's the only reason I don't play it like I used to.",3
It fun to play with your friends and family but its hard to play when it you first time it gives me pros lobbys when I was level 4 it happens to me a lot but I don't know if it does to all the players but it is like black cop but you get the hang of it soon or later I don't know I like it because I have a PS4 and I have back cop on it every time my brothers have it I playing on this game and it fun I got bann for no reason I was Level 150 but now I am Level 47 so yeah that why I give it 4 Stars,4
I have one problem and that is there's no zombies I really liked zombies I kinda got annoyed sometimes but that was my favorite oh and you took the rebirth island of mobile that made me mad and the tournament you had to have all 10mill of the maps or however many there were so yea,4
Awesome game it's worth playing it's fun and intense. I agree the old zombies was cool however there should be a selection if you want the zombies or not.,5
"smooth, great graphics and gameplay seggestion- you should be able to rank up faster depending on your performance you have to play with beginners a lot",5
It kept cancelling during the update. I wasted my data twice. The second time it got to 100% and still cancelled.,2
"Really good game, great game even, but as an underage user I'd like to point out that there's a lot of older men messaging me saying very lewd things to me and no action has been taken. I'm 13 years old, there shouldn't be 25-year-old men asking me if I'm ""freaky"" or if I want to see their ""dong"" no matter what I say to them they never stop I always have to block and report them. And no action is ever taken after I report them. That's the only reason I gave two stars. This is a serious issue!",2
Season 5 worst update ever. Full of lag my mob oppo a9 4 gb ram and 128 full of lag. I uninstalled this gameüòì. This is my one and only favorite game but i can't play.üò≠ I'm started playing this game 2 years. Full of waste üò≠,1
I tried updating it twice and when it gets to 100% it doen't install then the download gets cancelled. 4GB of data gone down the drain,1
I like this game but its size and it's updates -_- and too much lag and high ping also i cant play br because of lag game needs optimization not fake optimization by the way my device is not end device game need more improvement and optimize the game please and sometimes when I upadate it stucks on 100% and it take my while net still unable to update the game,3
"Hello everyone I have ever done playing codm every days many more than that I interested in codm is the one best üëå It's a question now so why are unlimited to team deathwatch-40, search & destroy-4, domination-100 and hard point-150 is like that?! Unfair I am not limited enough yeah it's true, you see call of duty modern warfare do continue to make more team deathwatch-75, search & destroy-6, domination-200 and hard point-250 fine is better not ranked, I really am DEAFü§ü",5
"This game is the best, good graphics, easy controls, and if you want to friend me -indo the gamer, I'm really good!",5
Downloaded the game just now on my Samsung S20 fe 5g phone and when i start the app the download configuration shows as failed and tells me to make sure that the game is connected to the internet and restart it whereas the wifi is well connected..please fix this issue guys,1
I enjoy every bit of the game. And I can spent hours playing it without stop. My major problem is the constant large updates.,2
Fix your network issues. My WiFi and Mobile Data are very good. They work very well everywhere but not in codm. This was the reason why I deleted codm and went for Apex Legends Mobile,1
Amazing the controls are good and the graphic is good you can adjust the graphics and controls. I recommend you playing,5
This game is good but I play ranked and I was on rookie 1 and had YouTubers in my game this made me mad because I'm new to the game but going against players that's on the leaderboard same for warzone I play with people way better than me this need to be fixed on both warzone and call of duty mobile.,1
Game is fun and very unique comparing other shooter games. Many real guns are also there in the game. I hope in season 5 you nerf persistence please like seriously that's the only problem every one is rage quitting,4
Best game to play either by yourself or with friends best graphics to play on either phone or any other platform but awesome game to play it could be stressful sometimes but overall its a good game to play.,5
"I got a problem with one specific assault rifle the man o war its control is horrible i have the control at 53 and its vertical recoil is very bad there are other assault rifles i use that have control at the 50 range like the m4 and it has very little vertical recoil i used every assault rifle, smg and lmg rifle that had control in the 50 range and they all had very little vertical recoil the man o war should not have a lot of vertical recoil if it's control is at 53 please fix this.",3
"These game is rubbish after the new update,, it lags alot like an old video,,, please remove that update or else these game is declared useless because the lagging is too much,, must you update a game that is fine we don't complain,, I will stop playing these game if you don't fix dis error",1
Always giving legendary weapons in wild draws which opens at last. Only for once gave in bundle which was much more sensible and worth. Not doing it anymore. It sucks. Give legendary weapon bundles again!!!üò°üò°üò°,1
"Pretty good game except for zombies. The maps are good and battle royal is fun. But if your gonna spend money on the game, be careful.",4
COD mobile is one of the best mobile shooter games out there. Controller compatible. If you put all other COD games in one game it would definitely be this one.,5
Been a COD fan since PlayStation 3.. this game doesn't disappoint.. have played it across different platforms. I also enjoy it alot on my mobile.. 1st game I download/update after getting a phone.,5
"This game is pretty fantastic. The only place to improve is that it's definitely a pay to win game. If you're spending, the advantage is astronomical.",4
"If you don't have access to PC/Xbox/PS and you love COD, this is the answer to your prayers. Excellent game play. No lag, even using cell data.",5
no support from the developer. don't wast your money there's a lot of company sponsored hackers in the game. no developer support. I HAD AN ISSUE WHEN I BOUGHT SOMETHING OVER A 2 YEARS AGO AND REACHED OUT TO SUPPORT AND THEY NEVER RESPONDED TO MY ISSUE SO YAH THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SUPPORT FOR ANY ISSUE.,1
Bring back the 10 vs 10 team deathmatch. I started to play more of it then you guys got rid of it. Dont feel like playing on it anymore without it..,1
Game is pants The AI in games have no clue whatsoever about using the environment on they die on approx 15 times each where you may die once andl loose matches So realistically in matches don't expect the AI to actually stay put when respawning when enemy uses vito or any helicopter as you will see Why cannot we have a option of AI in games or not I'd rather have a 1 v 5 on my own jack with no AI would be nice and maybe I might actually win a match or 2 but as it stands impossible,1
"Downloading continued even after 100 % downloaded showed, and suddenly again asking for updates. I wasted around 2 GB of data. I do not want to update again.....",4
When I update the game it's shows finished but then in game I have to download in game resources again like 1-2 gb. So whenever your new update comes include these (mini) in-game resources in that means at Play Store or app store.,3
I'm so mad right now I had this game for a long time now but for some reason it didn't save my progress so I had to start all over again if I could get my progress back that will be the best thing ever because I would be a lv 85 instead of Lv 1 plz fix this,2
Time out bug Game can't open eventhough I have good data and network. Showing 99% loading error. Please rectify it.Otherwise many people uninstall app due to it's error.,1
"Probably the best shooter game i've played, better than free fire and PUBG etc... Sure there are some glitches and mistakes but they'll get fixed soon because the developers actually listen to us players and appreciate us telling them about the glitches And after all, i think call of duty mobile is the best game ngl",5
"This game is just exceptional. Much better than Pubg by the way. The graphics are amazing, and there are so many different choices of guns. The best game I ever played",5
"Great game but the constant upgrade is just depressing, it's taking up so much storage and I don't have a thousand dollars to get a high performance phone to play your game",2
Awesome just awesome but the only problem I have is that it would be cool to have it offline and to also add in a campaign mode to play it offline but the rest is fine just wish there was an offline mode,5
"Perfect game...only one minus point is that this game is made with unity engine.....the game would be more realistic if it was made with unreal engine....otherwise the game is the best of the bestttüî•üî•. And waiting for your next game, Call of duty Warzone Mobileüî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏ècan't wait anymoreeeüî•üî•üî•",3
"I played at launch and recently reinstalled, but my phone won't give root directory access or whatever when this game asks for it. Can't get into my account. Google pixel 4a, Android 12",3
Definitely a game I recommend. I play it when I get mad. It helps control my anger. Only thing I don't like about it is the constant updating for it. But I love the game too much to get rid of it,5
Possibly the best mobile game available. Tons of characters and weapons and enough maps to keep it interesting.,4
"For some reason the app is not updating. It goes up to 100% then gets stuck, after a while it restarts the update process",1
Really great graphics even on low setting but overall it's great I think you should improve the lags cuz there are lags sometimes between the game which can lead to me losing the game but overall üëç,4
I loved the game since the OG time but rn some guns are just too overpowered and unnecessary nerfs to alrebad guns won't chance the game. I still love it and play it hourly I'm addicted to the game but I just hope the meta gets changed or something coz rn it's making the game boring.,3
"Updates are unnecessarily large and too often, player get logged out during game and can't get back in once a 3seconds network error happens",2
COD mobile is an awesome game and is the best shooting I have ever played üéÆ But I don't like fact that we use real money to get CP what about we that doesn't have bank account we can not buy a lengandary character or even weapon. That's my problem with the game but still enjoyable üòä,5
There is some problem with the new update sometime opponents lag and come at us with an unimaginary speed it is happening a lot. Please fix it. Besides i have strong network connectivity and using Asus ROG-3.,5
Great game and graphics. Been playing this for years now. I'm updating from a 3 to a 5 star because game is not glitching and is stable compared to my review 2 years ago.,5
"This game was amazing, I even played enough to get to Grand Master. Now It's just an average game that I'll play with my friends or just to pass time. Trust me though it's a fun game",4
There sth wrong with this update...it's at 100%...but keeps starting this is the fourth time an downloading again...but the game is just amazing üëåüèª...that's why I keep on trying to update,3
"Codm is a cool and fun game, I just love everything about this game except the CP it's hard to get even one CP and I don't know why, and also too much lagging everytime you update the game which gives problems while playing it üòï",3
This is the best shooting game on mobile ever. I've never experienced any problems with the game. Absolutely amazing. It's been like 6 months now and my love for the game is growing by the day.,5
"Nice game, please make the Manual and Auto control be compatible. Like, easily switch in game, or make them playable at once for a 5 stars. Thanks",4
Awesome for a mobile game.For one the snipers are overpowered like crazy and I love the good ads times on the guns and the attachment choices. I even acted dumb and put a sniper scope on an AR lol for the heck of it,5
The game is fun but constant lag makes me rage. Needs to be fixed cause it makes the game bad. It makes me lose joy. Call of Duty moble pls fix the lag,3
"Best game with many different things, Like operators,scorestreaks and new map,guns on every seasons.Im just loving it.Great work.",5
"Occasional stutters and lags, and with the newest update the bots have rare and paid skins, both of which are not good.",4
Best mobile game ever so far iv ever played it for say anyone has ever played so plz keep up all the good work love the graphics they are so good and the sound effects are perfect the variety of things u can do is amazing so keep that up as well thx alot from ryan Manzoni,5
It's a perfect game. But the update pops up too often and the size of the update is too much. Too many large files.,4
"I really love this game but you really need to fix the bugs, I use a high end phone and the game lag sometimes and slow down on the updates please, it's still a beautiful game though",4
Good but defiantly a dieing call of duty takes a while to get matched and 9 times out of ten everyone in your lobby are bots due to the lack of players not playing match making multi-player.,4
"I really love this game, I kinda wish there was a easier way to get the battle pass with out buying it but besides that I really love it. Great game play, good visuals",5
"Great game... But I have to drop my rating due to the inability to login to my my social account to play,apart from the lagging experience that's accompanied with it.",3
It's such a great game (Edit) minus 2 star because persistence is... and you can't see the dog specialist you can't see it on the minimap sometimes and you just die,3
The BEST online game I have EVER played!! I have been playing for years and will continue forany years to come!! Thanks to the call of duty team. BRAVO!! üëèüëèüëè,5
Again 1.53 GB update but why ? Can't you zip it ? It consumed 7.1 gb of space its a bit more for any of the smartphones. devops its not a lap or desktop. Whatcha doin ? I think it will become a GTA V (100GB),2
"The game is very good , graphics are fabulous but in last update there is a bug in BR the screen goes black during BR but the game is still run in background",5
"Game as such is surprisingly satisfying. That being said, it feels like there are too many bots in matches or the matchmaking sucks. Also my phone keeps heating up a lot..",5
Listen..... Iam in Lov with the kill animation... There's milli second somewhere in that moment that satisfys me sooo much other than that... The graphics are on point... And the game really makes u feel like a ps player... I enjoyed everything. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÑüëç,1
Great game but I'd like to lock opt-out (CCPA) from selling any personal information it might pick up. It unlocks/disables after every game.,3
It was working fine but all of a sudden I'm getting kicked off and the whole game shutsdown....also I can't seem to download anything or play the game with Wi-Fi what the hecks up with that? To Idk what to do...l plz help h he 4,2
Enjoy! The game isn't playable cus for me my connection fails to load and sometimes i load into a game get some kills and it says connection failed Waiting Timeout or somthin its very not likeable to play a game that cant play itself. So 1 star,1
It's unnecessarily too hard to spot enemies in Multiplayer mood even with full brightness. You need to fix this asap so 2 stars for now.,2
"COD mobile is a very good game, especially if you've played any other cod game before, the only thing is that some guns are not as good on cod mobile as they are in let's say modern warfare or warzone, still a very good game",5
"As far a Mobile shooters go CODM does not disappoint, one of the best I've ever played with amazing weapons, maps, and graphics that fans would expect from Activision!",5
"So pretty decent overall but the problem i have is theres a new update and I deleted 13 apps to try and get it and it was on the installing thing and said ""cannot install call of duty"" so i had to re-download the whole app",4
"It s a great game. It has good graphics, the movement is good, but the only thing that i don t like is that it doesn t have a single player storyline. Please add it",5
It is great but to shoot it aims and makes it slower to shooting your enemys and the shooting throw the aim off and it is harder to hit them,5
"Great game honestly no other shooting game beat codm, the problem is that the game requires alot of space i have already used 13GB on my internal storage so if i want the game to complete then im outta space. Other than that the game is perfect",4
"I love this game but it has been crashing lately, I tried playing and even Uninstalling it but it doesn't work... Please fix this problem I really love and want to play this game",2
Good and bad. I'm trying g to update to season 5 but every time e I try it gets stuck at 41 then the download stops I thought it was from my phone so I updated my software but it's still not fixed pls help me,4
I'd like to tell the team about one thing that if these updates going on increasing our storage then there will be deletion of game more... because not all people can have storage but all has good desire to play...hope you'll look after my review.,4
"This game ,,,,,, is joke I have been playing the game since it was realse it had no lagging problem at all but now always lagging when joining a multiplayer match it start lagging till the end I prefer APEX LEGEND for real guys if possible just quit codm and let's go to apex legend like IFREG yt",1
"Loading issues, lags and just overall gameplay has gone down, its very frustrating and its difficult to enjoy them game.",4
Think this game is amazing. This p2p and free 2 play remarks are bad. I haven't ever paid and am quite good. Get mvp 80% of the time. You just need to learn how to play first before you'll get good guns with good upgrades. Thanks,5
"Phenomenal gameplay!! Very very user friendly, and very easly learned fast enough to become good enough as a novice that even with decent competition i can perform above satisfactory at least to me",4
"please developer, add different gun combinations in every match in Gun game moshpit solo and team fight mode. capture the flag game mode is very good, also make these modes permanent.thanks",5
"I actual love this game, when it doesn't lag or glitch that is. But over all I have been playing for a while now and it's always been an awesome go to game.",4
This game is increasing its size every month. Also downloading in-game files through cellular data is very very slow rather in play Store the application is downloaded in minutes. Why the data speed is being decreased while downloading in-game files???,2
"Great graphics, constant upgraded content, fun , nostalgic and easy to play ! My favorite COD since mw2,3 and black ops 2 .",5
The game is awesome though I didn't give 5 stars is because during one of the seasons my game was bugged so I lost my progress but I have my Activision account so I'll just restart from there,4
"Once you're in the higher levels there's hardly any chance of surviving unless you pay for guns , can't even get a shot out after revival without getting killed",3
Fun that you can even battle to the death and when anything you want to try this game out please and have fun and you can play with friends and family and get cool guns and u can play it any time you want it's a free game so download now,5
"Plz try to keep BR Alcatraz permanently, because its the only source of fun in BR or likewise alcatraz plz add some new maps rather, but plz try to keep Alcatraz permanently, because its the only mode where we can see continuous actions, and I like it, plz",5
Great game! Been playing since it came out and I enjoy it just as much as playing on a console. Graphics are amazing and the game itself is just spectacular for being a mobile game. Keep up the great work!,5
"Great game.The one problem is that ranked mode should have made, such that players in a certain rank can only play together like in pro ranks 1 to 5 can play together, not mixed like pro 1 VS master 3 and stuff.Pls fix this.",4
"It's all great except I don't get the zombies playing option. I get ranked, battle royale, multi-player and then tournament.",3
Game is much better than a year ago. Theres still some issues but hey you cant control the players and your not gonna ban premium users so it is what it is. Still lots of fun,4
Please it would be great if the new multiplayet maps could be used to form a new battle royal map just like isolated and blackout thank you.,5
"This game has everything you want especially if you love to snipe like i do the best sniper game ive ever played as well as BR and pvp, the weapons are so customizable its rediculous the graphics are amazing if youve never played your missing out make friends or enemies if i could rate this a 20 id rate it 100",5
"The only game I've ever spent money on lol, it's really good. Also super addictive and free! Be careful I need to hold myself back from playing everyday",5
The graphics of the game are sublime. It gets regular updates. The charaters are great. This is the best mobile game ever,5
"Have to give it 5 star, nice game, I've been playing it for a year now and can't complain... Time for me to change my phone, my potato phone can't handle this game very wellüòÇüòÇüòÇ but it's a good game... *Better than PUBG*",5
This game is very addictive and fun to play with friends really the only reason i gave this game 4 stars is that they took away the old zombies which was so much more fun than the new zombies,4
Honestly I find it hard to play with a sniper I main sniper and than I load into a game while other people using smgs in multi-player its really annoying If you could help me resolve my issue it would be much appreciated thank you for your time,4
"Best game I have ever played great graphics and great gameplay, I'm just asking for one thing and that is if you can add death chat to your next update, like in cod warzone. Please üòï",5
Downloading is getting ridiculous....I thought it was cod mobile...no phones can take all space up ...ridiculous...it was fun just over doing it with the download ...update horrible...wants way to much space ...I'll pass on mobile and just play on ps,1
Fix storage for people because your making the app bigger y'all don't care about people all y'all people care about is money one star because I can't even update it and I'm still having black screen problems fix it because it's really annoying.,3
Awesome game play!! Best of all its free. Since it's free once in a while I spend some money on weapons and skins. This is the funnest moble app game ever!,5
Here's an idea for you developers.. since you can't stop the hacks or don't want to take the time to.. why do you make all hacks available for everyone.. maybe that will take less effort since the integrity of the game means nothing to you..,1
"I have enough storage in my device but I have limited data when I update this game, it's stop at 100% and my data still gets use and use but download doesn't stops. Fix this sh**.",2
Great game! One of the best BR games on mobile! Would highly recommend trying it out if you like Battle Royale style shooter games. Can play with your friends/clan.,5
"It deserved a 5 star before the latest update(8). Now, it's annoying to play. I wish you guys bring back the health option instead of the armour.",4
If you're better than other players people report you and you get banned. Which is very unfair. Also you hardly ever get lucky on those drawing you spending real money with. Plus every season there is always so issue with the game.,3
"I love the game and how you constantly post new content but a major issue is the ranking system, you really be having level 51 going against a 150. please fix it",4
Game is good but too many big big updates. There are frequently huge updates in the game. It is very hard to update as it is higher than daily data limit.,3
Bluetooth controllers are no longer working after updating. Season 11 the Bluetooth controller issue is fixed...,4
"Good game, Good graphics, fast pasted weapons are Good balanced, and competitive overall great first person shooter other than the fact it takes so much gs to download and has in game downloads on top of that that also take quite a bit of gs of storage",5
The game is quite awesome and addictive. Best action game so far but the persistent update should be checked. Update coming bi-monthly is not encouraging and it's large size too. Kindly do something about this,4
"Not capable to run on lower hand devices, even i have a good phone of samsung but i can play only few games without lag and hence it is so much unfair. They need to fix ot ASAP.",3
Man this game is good y'all should play it but the beginning it's kinda boring then you get gd weapons man I'm on level 47 and man I got op stuff y'all should download it they have great graphic it almost t like real life there tons of stuff to unlock and there is some op stuff,5
"Really good game the best mobile shooter game you can get, but I would like to see a offline mode. Maybe zombies or AI other than that 10/10.",5
"You should be able to just buy the characters your or whatever you want instead of draws. But we know companies are CHEAP AND GREEDY even though they would make more, that way no one is gonna keep spending to try. The numbers prove it.",2
"Im speechless, cuz this game is totally fps action adventure and soo realistic.. I love this game, and waiting for Call Of Duty Warzone Mobile... My 2nd dream come true.. Thank you all of teams and activision teams..",5
The gzme is very fun and I love it but trying to update for the 5th season isnot working so it won't let me play so if it does work I'll be happy and call of duty needs to add the 0ts9 the swiss and all kinds of gunes from call of duty warzone,5
Best multiplayer Mobile game I've ever played the graphics and skins of guns and character's are super detailed along with it the devs are improving the game and working with the community.,5
"Now that I can play this on my tablet I'm in gaming heaven again, for original black ops players this is the best game ever all the original maps including nuke Town... I mean what more could you want ..only for Acti to open up the zombies side of the game other than that UTTERLY BRILLIANT",5
"Really good game! But Im expiriencing one ANNOYING BUG wich is when you hop on the game and it asks you to log in with COD, Guest or Facebook. It is a stressing bug. If it gets fixed i May rate this a 5.",2
"Better than pubg I guess, but needs some little changes in the controls, should add peak option as well which is already there in pubg, besides that it's all good. Kudos to ya",5
The best game that is out there today. Me personally have no complaints. Fun for the whole family. Well almost the whole family. üòÅ Way to go guys üëèüëèüëèüëèü§üü§üü§ü. Thanks for the endless fun and the cure for boredom. I don't think anyone going to come close to this game it just that good....,5
I left a review a long time ago the very first season now I'll leave another it's a good game a great game actually just wish the system had a tad better graphics but all around great game it definitely could be better but it is my fav game on mobile,5
"Still has more time to put updates to itself and graphics are phenomenal üëåüèº personal opinion,game is great but can do better also to the fact that warzone mobile is making its way into development so yeah..9.25/10",4
Game on the whole is good but when I first downloaded i bought a pass straight away and within an hour it expired no warning customer care unhelpful and didnt care ..... nice to know you can legally rob a customer. Be very careful when buying passes,2
"One start not given, because of too many updates, and that too of GB's, like everyone cannot afford that much storage/internet. We don't really need that huge updates if u get that.",4
I used to be associated to coc an maby 1 or to other games but right now this game is the best by far the details the graphics the maps the skin weapons are insanely good an excellent . Thanx for awesome game üëç,5
"How many updates are you gonna give? We love playing the game a lot but if you keep increasing the number of updates and the update size, pretty soon the entire phone's internal storage will be consumed by this game. Could you please do something about it??",2
The game is good and all but the controller setting to use one does not work it I hook it up and the it lets me pick the controller it is but then it just keep saying connecting,1
Don't waste your time. It's call of duty which is why I played it but as usual hackers glitchers exploiters bad balance of game and guns. Company doesn't do anything about blatant cheats. Good game badly run and designed. Stay clear.,1
"Love this game. Graphics, tasks, multiplayer, weapons, characters, stages, it's pretty sick!",5
This is a very good game I love that it let's you play with other people and play multiplayer and battle Royale but when you have to update the game you can't play with others or its gonna show version to old,4
"I love shooting games :) Edit: that was my son who posted this review, but yes, I absolutely like this game. I play daily xD Another edit: the size of each downloads per season is crazy now. Still a 4.5 star game!!",5
This game is very good ... but it would've been better if it had an story mode you can play. The updates is also to much in a short time.,4
"The game was really good before. But after the recent update, the game does not go beyond ""getting version info"" on my galaxy s21 Ultra while connected to WiFi. Disappointed.",5
Great to play the game. Amazing graphics. Nice Control. Needs some update on the map.,5
Love the game but..... Hate the draw and how hard it is to get a legendary skin or gun without having like over 1000 cp And with every new update and every event the file size gets bigger and bigger making it harder to download,2
Been playing since the beginning. All of a sudden can't connect to battle royale isolated or blackout. Can play Alcatraz but losing out on clan points,5
"The game is nice, but the Melee weapons are to powerful and it's take away the felling of cod , but feels like WWE I would install the game after the next upade when the game is fixed.",1
"It's Fantastic, Lovely, everything is best. But the demerits of this game is it's cost to buy legendary equipments, which is a lot higher",5
"Never a dull moment, with the Call of duty team, keeping things refreshed constant improvement and upgrades and full of unexpected surprizes.Thank for being committed and driven!",5
"This game is very good but the only thing I hate is the optimisation of this game, like this game took 12 GB including hd resource. But the game needs optimisation in battle royal because I get 30 FPS but still, it is a great game.",4
"What is wrong with the game, repairing dynamic data every single time when it opens, crashes constantly",1
I don't know what happened but I put my Facebook account and then and then yesterday something happened to my account it won't let me in and when I deleted it and I downloaded it back it didn't let me download it and right now it does not download pls fix this call of duty,3
The best game in the world. It was so good that i am playing it from 3 years every single day. But the dogs are so annoying üòÖ but still you don't deserve a 10 star but only 5 star is the max,5
"Literally it won't let me play with my controller please fix. I get kicked out of my account, I was level 78 really fix the game now I lost my account and I didn't cheat at the game and it won't let me get back in the app and just closes me out",1
"Cool game i think its pretty cool cuz wr can do a lots of things in it like Battle Royale, Multiplayer, Ranked Match and etc i love everything but can you guys pleaseeeee send the Zombie Apocalypse back to the game because people always love this gsme even more when it haves Zombie Apocalypse anyways love you Codm :D",5
"The only thing that could make this better is if you guys could make it not so big storage wise. Oh, and please. make part of the game playable offline.",4
Its a great and interactive game for when you have some down time and need something to do. Also just great all around for any reason.,5
"This is the best game...i haven't touch grass since i downloaded it, cuz there is endlessmissions...the only thing i think y'all should do is give 1 free spin on every lucky draw or atleast some...thx for the game",5
"I do have a problem with the fact that the kilo, which is based of the kar98k which is a german sniper during ww2 the scope isnt sitting in the correct spot. It should be above the chamber. Also is season 5 yall should add the ax50",5
I'm now giving it a 4 star rating it has gotten better but it's not a 5 star because the legendary gun situation *edit* it's back to 3 stars because cod mobile doesn't care about og players leaving they only care about the new comers pluse they don't care about the reviews people give to try to make the game better than it is they are into getting warzone mobile to come out they don't care about fixing the bugs cod mobile has *I know they have a lot of things to worry about but fix the bugs pls.,3
First bad things about it is that it will always glitch when you get on the game but it has good graphics and cool guns so I like the game after the glitching is over,4
It doesn't want to update. Or stops on 100% and doesn't do anything further And when wifi is on i can't stop the downloads i don't want. Not everyone has unlimited wifi,3
This game is the worst The HACKERS the hackers are so annoying and this game has NO Security it even does not ban hackers 2. BOTS The bots are so lame when I'm the only real life person and the rest are bots in my team I always lose... I wish I could rate it half a star.... If Activision could HAVE security and Bots that are actually pros then I would rate it 5 stars and give a good rating....Thanks for the update üëè,1
Honestly this game is so much fun. I love just playing it. But it dose have issues like for example it's very laggy at some points but besides that it's fun,3
Only thing I don't like you max out at level 150 when leveling up but I still give it five stars because I like the game and I got the problem figured out with my ranked game but other than that really good game for mobile,5
"Data consumer, if you planning to plya this game for just tap download & its redy to play then you have on wrong place, this take your lot of time & huge amount of data, if you download from mobile data please dont do this. i was faced many horriebel exprience to update this game also downolad this game.",1
The best mobile action game available. It would be better if there's some type of way to unlock mythic weapons by a merit system update.,5
I love this game. But the amount of updates and storage it takes for downloads is alot. If you have the patients for this. It's a good game. Very addictive.,5
Love this game but i mean its a little pay to win also in the chineese version they have free legendry blue prints so cmon atleast let that happen in the u.s version the last free blue print was for a operater skill not even a gun and that was sooo long ago but yeah. I still Love this game,5
"I love this game so much, they have everything that I would love to play and stuff that I enjoy my only problem is, is that it's a huge game so it takes up a lot of space. I would like it if if the Creators of the game can try and make the game not as big.",4
"I will stop playing soon, since every update it's a massive amount of space needed and game gets heavy, my smartphone can't hold before, now i hope i can still play a little.",5
Superb modes I love it.multiplayer is awesome with many types of maps.best shooting game.graphics are great but in low internet connection problem arises plz solve that issue .,5
The game is very good and I have been playing it since 2021 but I want call of duty to bring back the 2019 version of battle royal I know it was a old map but I leally miss it,5
It's great I love this game I played all the call of duty games bet this game is good but I just wish that they can make a campain or make a story behind it I say it's a good 5 in a half but rn it's 5 star that's my rating.and thank you for making a agood game plays and experience,4
This is an amazing game. You get to costomize your gun to make it how you can control your character. The different characters and skins for the weopons looks so sick.,5
Fixed the bugs I was having an issue with. Games honestly one of the best mobile BR/MP games out. Updates are consistent bugs are addressed and best of all cheaters are now minimal.... Present but minimal,4
CoD has been amazing for the years that it has been around and this reminds me of old CoD games like MW3 MW2 and MW4 and it has battle royal that reminds me of Warzone And you can take it every where now. I recommend this to people who like battle games.,5
"At first I used to love the game, I still do but I do not know what the problem is nowadays. Every time I launch it, even with a stable connection, it says downlaod configuration failed, that I need to connect it to a network. I don't understand what the problem is. One star until the problem is cleared.",3
That's the second time that i try to update the game. 100% and it stay like this with no more information. Please repair this bug!!!!!,5
All these periodic updates are very unnecessary. They make the game lag and considering many of the players don't even play all modes.,3
I played with 2 years codm mobile game... Realy awesome this multiplayer and battle Royal are amazing. I love CODM... Very nice graphics and characters in game.so let's played on Codm everyone.,5
"The game would have great if there were no lag, desync and server problems in the game. Please kindly fix these things.",4
Game is having black screen bug. I restart the game whenever it happens. Resolve this problem,3
"Love the game but the main issue I've stopped spending is there is no lucky draw, you keep spending to get a legendary so better to play for free and stop spending for useless skins",1
"Perfect game for people on mobile and can't play cod anywhere else No ads, cool weapons, great advanced controls.",5
"Graphics are good and if you are into military you would like this free game but there some players who are a sweat so but it's ok, this game has good gamepasses and you would probably like it üòâ",4
"I lost all my progress after the new update,I have wasted my time playing this game if I can't get anything back.I have spent money on the game and I hope to get a refund unless I get my account back.",1
"There's a reason for why ""gun"" rhymes with ""fun"" call of duty is proof of that, though not gonna lie... Has gone pretty downhill since Bo3 but hey, fun for the most part though vanguard is trash, but this game isn't vanguard so why the comparison anyway, I give it 8 no scopes/trash talking out of 10",4
I am facing alot of issues after update every 2nd time when i play the game its says time out and time out again and again my internet connection is great and it keeps saying that thats so fustrating,2
It wont download. It keeps on declining the download. I have space. I have no restricions applied. It overall is a good game but it does not want to download,1
"I truly love this game. Being playing it since 2020. I have a suggestion though. Could the next season be a Naruto themed game? Lucky draw could have a Shinobi, a Kunai, a gun that has a rasenshuriken kill display. It'll be sick.",5
Well I really love this game but the new update is killing me I can't stand it is really frustrating at this point people will drop and it won't be fun any more it's a game for crying out loud please work on the updates it's too much peace every one üò¢ üôè üòû üíô,2
Best Android game by far.. But If the ms in the servers could be reduced so every player in the Game have just a slight delay by one to two or fair amount of ms it would be excellent... Some regions have ms as high as 50-100,3
"Excellent game, but I have just one issue and that is that the game updates so often that it is soooooo annoying. Instead of that everything is really good",4
"Update everyday is superior Anoying.... I can't even play the game as soon as I open it,.... it like when network is slow....I wld have to open the game firs and and do sth else damn...",4
"Edit: After latest update, controller is connected but not working Sometimes I'm unable to open the game with Wifi, it says 'network connection is required' But if I switch to mobile data it is working fine",1
"Best game ever , idk what this glitch is but i downloaded a update it went to 100% and stoped and nothing happened for like 30 mins and then i closed play store and opened it again and it went to 0% so fix this plz and yeah it happened twice",5
There should be an option available to change background music and list of songs from all seasons.,5
The game is very fun one of the best TPS and battle royale game thats out rn but i must say that the game has been pushing out a lot of lucky draws that are really expensive and not has many bundles that are more cheap for free to play players,4
"Great game! Love to play, Although i used to play BGMI/PUBG before, but due to some issues i shifted to CODM and seriously it's amazing. No words are there to describe. Absolutely a marvelous game. Appreciate it üëèüèªüëèüèª",5
"Nice, please try to keep optimizing the game for weaker devices as well. Lately game lags too much, it did not use to so it. it is annoying...",4
"This is one of the best games to ever be on mobile devices. Almost everything in this game just makes you want to play more. The only problem I have with this game is that is takes up way to much of space , but other than that it's really nice.",4
Good game. But now connecting issue is very big problem. I am using Facebook for login. Unable to play a single play in a day.,1
"The game is fun and tons of things to enjoy. But why does it get laggier by each update? How can this game lag on SD 720g, even on low graphics ü§∑?.. I mean c'mon!!!!!!",4
Plz can you fix camos for battle royal mode I have an epic and it shows that i have and thats its equipped but it does not appear in hand when am playing in battle royale My tactical zooms doesnt allow aim movement and when i see others use it they can freely move,1
It's a fun game which I got addicted to in about a week. But you do need a decent device to run but if you do have one the is one of the best mobile games out there right now.,5
"The game occupies 70% of my phone storage now, rated it a 5 star but now I can't even enjoy the game with my device, every update also requires you to redownload all you've already downloaded, it's not cool please.",1
I bought the limited cp bundle that also gives one free crate. I bought 3 of these bundle but i didn't get any of the cp and crates even though the money has been deducted. Scam I want a refund now.,1
"I love it, this is the only video game I play since I don't agree with violence games , but I liked this one especially Search And Destroy, as it is a team cooperative game.",5
A lot less bugs. Play this daily. Ranked points per game could be higher... Getting MVP and constant 10+ kills in BR should give more ranking points to reduce the grind.,4
Best mobile FPS game so far great graphics I wish you'd make hd graphics optional my device will support medium to HD graphics but it's not available.,5
From 3 days I'm trying to open this game but it's always show's download configuration failed. So I deleted my game and download it again but same things happen again. üò°üò°üò§,1
The updates all the time are horrible...it's to the point yiu have to spend hours weekly updating the game...you can pretty much never just log on there like 15 minutes worth of updates every day,1
"Used to be the best game. Now it's trash. Game filled with unnecessary toxic stuffs, bugs. And the devs don't give a damn about fixing any of it. Not even worth rating a star.",4
Why every time m updating updating n keep updating...After update 100% it's shows that can't updated..Why wasted of data...3 time I wasted my data...Worst experience...m big fan of this game..But after that I m going to uninstall...Goodbye.,1
Now this is enough codm I told you I don't want this glitch but you didn't litsen I told you that when I update the game it show its 100% done but it doesn't install the update means why do you want to make you own players leave codm for this punny glitch. And it's not me also there are other thousands that can't upade so plz its your last warning or I guess I'll leave you game and I don't want to cause I am an OG player too. Playing since 3 yrs so plz fix it fast..!!!!,1
I'll say this much this game is over all fun but today I had someone hack my account after playing this game since day one lunch because they where a sore looser first time I've ever had this happen lucky they really sucked at hacking cause I got back into my account and was able to change my password up got all my stuff back that I ever paid for. Don't let this stop you from enjoying the game it's a lot of fun just ignore the couple of jerks that play and call you a cheater for killing them.,4
Good game... But there's a bug when you log in your account it says timeout I tried many times to log in but it always says timeout I don't know why please fix this,4
very good the graphics are great all the guns are realistic and gives you stuff for free like guns and skins overall it's really good,5
Activision!!! This is what you guys are doing. A lot of people are leaving CODM because of it's ping very high and slow. Why don't you fix it?,3
Its good after all but i guess you have to keep more options to talk to teammate like if the enemy is near and the teammate dosent know atleast there should be an option to warn them then rest yeah its good.,4
The BEST Multiplayer game out there on the Play Store! The graphics is above unbelievable. Since I bought a new phone I saw how good this game is. Keep up the work! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"The very best mobile game. Nothing less of decent, uh uh, shocking graphics and a good gameplay. ALERT; This one's a really addictive.",5
"It's a fun FPS shooter and isn't pay to win but there needs to be skill based match making and one thing, when you get a skin you also get the gun and that's a bit overpowered",5
"It's good and all but the issue is that I can't update codm,i have lots of space still but nothing happens,it stays at 100 percent but doesn't update,pleas help me.",5
"Totally crashed game graphics ,only the good controls is all to enjoy , killing every time expectations in each update.",1
The game is cool. I love everything besides the lagging and glitching while I'm in the middle of a game. That really takes the fun out of the game.,4
"This game is so well made, thank to all the people that worked hard to code this game,you guys are overwhelmingly amazing.Please if you guys can, make cod points cheaper for us in regions where our currency is low.i understand that it will affect your profit margin,but maybe then people will spend more money on cod points because it's affordable.Keep up the incredible work and for that I will always play your game.All you guys have done alot for us and Ur effects will never be forgotten.Thanks",5
My game is not logging in through facebook since I've been playing the a while it was working perfectly but now it's showing authority issue kindly look into this bug....,1
Love it love it only thing I dont like is some players use real controllers which is a major advantage to others who are using the phone for game play. Otherwise great game,5
I give this game four stars because it's a bit gicthes and I got a idea for the game a campaign. Pls make a campaign because nearly every other call of duty have a campaign eg: call of duty WW1,4
"I played from many years and I love only this game ,i never installed any other game in my phone but today i faced some configuration glich that can't allow me to open the game and it shows me some internet error but not really because I purchased new phone 3 days before i installed game and yesterday when update is available,i update and play many hours then today i open purchased battle pass and then game shows me same error then i tried 10 time to open game but now I'm reinstall the game.",5
I'm enjoying the call of duty mobile game. I have never been a call of duty player on the game consoles but the mobile version has me hooked like a dope fiend.... love it!!!,5
I have tried to download this new update 6 times but it is not downloading. Every time after 100 percent it stops and again shows update option. I am fed up with this,1
"This game is good in some terms but it really sucks in alot of other terms! Yeah wanna know why? Cuz the chance of lucky draw items are not the same, the developers are forcing you to spent more and more money just to get something cool ?besides that there is planty of hackers who can hack into your account or use aimhack wallhack etc... This game is made out by bunch of cheapo leeches, respect your Customers and do something usefull ACTIVISION",1
"Very good game, easy to play, and good graphics. Quality control on people could be better, but other than that very good",5
Great game I have been playing the next day after I got my phone I like it but I wish zombies was added back it is good and the Melee is op you can go around the Map with a machete and be mvp I got the ultimate terminator it is so easy they need to nerf Melee,5
Best game every played by me. I can't imagine leaving this game ever. I changed my device from an old 3gb Android phone which lagged like hell but now the experience in the game is buttery smooth,5
"Awesome game with ultimate graphics locations weapons etc character's are well equiped all of the game is nice,one suggestion pls add chopper mode also like the tank battle,it will be more fun thanks",5
Much better since updates games is now faster and much more fun to play. Graphics have had a great update since the beginning. Well done.,5
"Best game I've ever play but the draws are too costly especially the crate, what I suggest is increasing the chance or odds of getting either the gun or character skin.",5
I love this game so much I play it at home and at work on my lunch break with my son and daughters they love it to hope we see more maps and more guns and more fun graphics,5
Game is 10/10.Other than alot of space constantly needed to play and for updates...Id say best mobile game on the market.BUT....BRING BACK ZOMBIES full time!!!!PLEASE FROM THE COMMUNITY!Balance between f2p n p2p is better than most.You can still own lobbys without spending üí∞üí∞,5
"This is a really good game and I love playing it. The only problem I have with it is that it will crash sometimes even though. If this i fixed, then I'll give it 5 stars.",4
the best game i have ever played it is very good lot of setting to mess around a ton of contend more content evry 40 days and small updates many gamemodes but the micro transaction i guess it is fair for activation is way to greedy but i hope Microsoft can fiz this game,5
Hey team activation Kindly try to remove hackers. almost every 50 match I found 20+ hackers in ranked mode. I raised complaint against them but the problem is same. They are using hacks continuously ü§®ü§¨,1
This is easily the best game on mobile. It jist has some bugs and network issus but it can be overlooked.,5
A big problem for people is everytime it have to update why do it take up so much space its like your trying to make this the only app on or phone üì± I have to delete app my app and I have a 32g Mcard & a 32 internal storage,1
I love this game. But I have the biggest problem with people hacking my account. If you want to catch probably the biggest group of cheaters I'll play everyday at 5pm. Ela standard time. The the worst. Good luck.,5
"Looking for some good graphics and some good entertainment this is one of the best games ever made üíØ üåü there's nothing that can beat this game not even counter strike,so COD IS THE GAME DOWNLOADE IT ASAP!!!",5
Best... But when it comes to update.. It gives error very time.... I update stops on its own... But not sure if this happens with everyone..,4
This is a great üëç. But the storage data and all is eating up too much space on my gadget and it's becoming unbearable.,3
This was absolutely irritating!!!! At first you will get bots in mp matches after some time there will be bots in ur team and the real players will be in opposing team. So ur team will be fked up! This happened with me every time so this time im not gonna stay cool. Im deleting this,2
Totally useless game after the new update. The game closes once the the match gets started. Guys move back to Pubg this game is waste of data. Dont play it.,4
Call of Duty 4 is cool game and what was talking to them the people in there is cool Annette School have a good day game store and it's really cool really cool really cool and really cool game cuz 34 the coolest game on the phone and on the PS4 and I don't have colored 24 on my PS4 because I don't know how to get it on there a PS4 card chicken cooked through 4 and it's a question ever seen I've talked to people in there now and at making friends sooner and a school everything School a cool game,5
"after spending a year plus a in this game i think there is no such game present in the mobile gaming section across all devices which is better than this one here in specifically in BATTLE ROYAL genre, so enjoy here and also i like cod to better introduce ""punkbusters"" here.",5
"Call of duty is a very fun game to play, but I thing you guys should put Call of Duty on play station so you guys can get lot of people there too and people don't only need a phone to play it",5
"Depending On How You Play, This Game Could Be A Time Waster. Then Again The Pleading Of Others Crawling For Help Is Always Good To Answer To. -Healer -DPS Strategist -Scavenger -Melee Specialist -I Do Tank, Sometimes Depending If I Want To Carry Extra Armor Or The Team ü§£",5
"I have been trying to update the app but my app goes to 100% but doesn't install , and it says season 5 update but on play store it says season 4 please help me this issue is costing me alot of data",1
"One of the best games for mobile! I fkng love it! To much going on with a lot of offers and challenges and this and that, but runs great üëç",5
I've been playing this game since it came out at first it was a little laggy now and it's performance it's got an a+ and five stars for me. Thanks Activision!!,5
"My account was hacked, my friends list was cleared, my loadouts changed, my name changed, and I can't clear the info on the account to fix this.",1
"It's good in playing , smooth and clear graphics but usage of data is high with 150 mbs I can only play 2-3 br matches only it needs to reduce that please",5
The game is fantastic and there are no ads also i have not found any hackers but there are several modes which i like and they are available in very much time thats the only bad thing about the game,5
"LOVE THIS GAME. Sadly I gave it 3 stars,I can't get past when it puts me in the middle of a game. When I try to join multi-player it puts me into an already going game.",3
Why does it have so many updates every now and then? So inappropriate I know. But it also has its best side - a variety of game modes & graphics.,3
"it's a good game but for me it glitches me sometimes out of the game. It has really cool maps though, and you can play with friends",4
I loved this game since day 1 the only complaint i have is maybe that the rank point dedunnction is too high. I think 60 is better than 80.,5
Amzing game fun to record with friends for and makes it fun cause at lvl 30 i signed up for the wrold championship and did really good so its pretty eazy for all ages and fun tons of people and friends you will make on the way,5
"New season is gr8 with the Persi nerf and balanced guns . This season is gonna attract a lot of people this time. Only issues are lag and ping , so my only complain is that ......... Overall best game in my opinion :)",5
This is one of the best games I played an i love it an the graphics is excellent üëå As a gamer I would recommend a lot of people to play this game . Thanks for making this game great url deserve a 5 star.,5
"WHEN I OPEN THIS , THATS WAY TO SEE THE BEST GRAPHICS ,ARE BEST BUT THERE IS NO ANY MAP ANOTHER THAN CLASSIC IN BATTLE ROYALE, THE GAME IS STOPPED MANY TIME . MOST LAGS IN THIS GAME. BUT BEST GAME THAT I LIKED VERY MUCH.. EXCELLENT GAME",2
"Call of duty mobile in my opinion is one of the best games that you can play on phone or Tablet or etc. As an Iranian person,I love this game even in Iran,I want to thank Activision because they did a great job and the quality is insanely good.",5
Call of duty is a very good game and its fun to play but the fact that anytime I am updating my game I get to loose twice the data size of the download.,5
Nice game!! The only thing that always made me frustrated is the title screen ü•µ..... So much loading time!,4
Can't download the update. It's 1.53 GB and I have space on my phone. I even deleted Apex Legends.. thinkin about deleting CODM now and I been playing since 2019,2
I've been playing codm since the beginning and now because of a lack of imagination and greed I change my review to 1 star. I'm really close to uninstalling the game.,1
My device is 4gb ram and still yet the game tends to hang while playing. I suggest better optimization be done so the game can still be playable,4
"Great game, all the good stuff from the game in a compact mobile game. Takes alot of memory but overall worth it for the immerse backdrops and overall graphics",5
"I played pubg its banned in india but i searching in Play Store my eyes focused on call of duty so much hap there is only one map in classic mode but in multiplayer mode there is a many maps , So please add atlast one map like pubg Miramar , Vikendi, Sanhok",3
"Need one thing Is tpp pratice mode specially for battle royale with AI bots There is only mp pratice mode and i need to practice shotgun quick scope and lots of movement for that I have to play single battle royale but if there is tpp pratice mode with AI bot and big space , it will be lot easy for me üëäPlease provide battle royale tpp pratice mode with AI botsüëä",5
I have fun playing this game but in battle royale mode when i was in game suddenly screen just turns black there is sounds but i cant see anything i dont know it about my device or game problem Please help me to fix,4
Really like this game. I got a new phone but now have lost everything. Was on level 150 but now back to level 1. Is it possible to get everything back?,5
"Cool game! But it makes my phone lag, and takes awhile to download! Also it lags alot. Other then that I decided to download it again so Imma check it out <3",2
The app update is too expensive.... the loading time takes like forever...in-game purchase and download too big and many.. Aside all that.. its a nice game,2
Love the game but the lock-on time for the heat seeking rpg takes to long to be able to get a shot off before the chopper gunner or v-tol gets to you.,4
Keeps closing the game unexpectedly ever since the latest seasons downloads.... such cause I've spent a lot of money on it since it came out.,3
"Extremely awesome mobile game. Gameplay, graphics are amazing. As good as any console game. Takes up a tremendous amount of storage, but still a ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ game!",5
"I Don't Like When You Have To Download New Seasons, Etc because It's ALWAYS A Very Long Process, even Over 24 Hrs Or More To Update App!!! I Do Love Playing just HATE the HACKERS!!!!!!!! #PlayingToHaveFunWishSomePeopleCouldStopCheatingPlease!!! ü§£",2
"Hello developers!, Can you please add vibration feature ( while shooting, landing from high location, driving/riding ,getting shot, etc",5
"I have been played Since 2019..No.1 Battle Game..Awesome Graphics,Need huge network speed after update I am not played single match without LagingüôÑ in multi-player ,BR AND Zombie Thrice platforms ü§Øplease fix it ü§Ø otherwise it Deserve 5+Stars Need huge optimization like others ‚úåüèªWe need smoother to other battles royal Games üéÆ Please üôèüèªüåæ",5
"great game on mid range devices but on my galaxy a12 every time a match starts i drastically loose frames, thats really the only down side.",5
My game used to run smooth with no problems but now everytime I play my game either lags freezes glitches or kicks me off it's getting annoying I can hardly play anymore without some kind of problem and all my other games work perfect so it's not my phone or my internet connection,5
"Fix the update Glitch, i update it 2 times from playstore and again it need update..update size is 1.4 gb and it is difficult for me to update it several times on slow wifi connection.its annoying thats why i go for 1 star ‚òπÔ∏èüò°‚òπÔ∏è",1
"New update. My Z fold 3 running on max settings or lowest; however, the games framerate plummets (glitches & lags). The game is not playable. The developers clearly don't care since this phone has been out since 2021, and there's been several updates since then have yet to take care of it. It's a great game to play, but it's upsetting to deal with it. New update fixed nothing",1
"I enjoy playing this game with family and friends. Very pricey for drawings and add ons but, its worth it. CODM change alot since it first came out. It's getting better and better with each update. I have some requests. Please bring back Prop Hunt and Dead of the Night 20x players. Please make a All Black Chrome Reaper Android Character. I've seen the Black Reaper 2 times in the steel drawings and is waiting. Thank you!",5
Wth with this game. Above 7gb update every time of update. Even have update for old downloaded maps even nothing's changed.,1
"I absolutely love this game! It's super easy to learn the mobile controls, and a lot of fun to play. I highly recommend downloading it!",5
"It has been a great experience but with every update the game gets worst in performance,you can't play a fair game with 4GB ram anymore and the lag is on bearable due to its required RAM and GB space of over 16GB",5
"Great game for mobile device, handles smooth and very enjoyable. I got a lot more than i was expecting. My only qualms are the loot box systems. Premium loot boxes and draws NEVER give the best items unless ALL other are claimed and every roll increases in price. Lack of random chance is a major let down for consumers! In addition any loot box earned through gameplay will always recycle the lowest tier items. Not P2W but still a very bad practice against those who invest in it, shameful!",3
I love playing this game on my free time because I have my moments of straight out annihilating of my enemies with a shotgun. But in a ideal world I definitely say I do screw up. Great Game and I really enjoy playing. Even if the game be going good then I be lagging up a storm. Probably hackers.,5
I mean the game play is good but I've done been locked out of two different accounts I don't know why I even tried to reset my password now and I don't even receive a email to change it. It's not cool to lose all your progress and have to restart all over again,3
"I love this game, but my ps4 controller stopped working. Had a 5 star rating, but going to 3 stars until this gets fixed. Update: I spent $60 on an Xbox one controller and it works, but shouldn't have to buy it in the first place. Ps4 controller still not working.",3
Cod needs to spend more time and money on Android users the response time the in game action is nothing like iOS iOS uses have better grafic faster response times and and better connectivity Android users need to have better game play and nonlag or glitching,5
"Glitches and freezes are bringing me down, just as I come around a corner where I know the enemy is , I freeze, leaving myself open for oncoming enemy fire by the time the glitch is over I'm done. Or I'm in the middle of a 2 on one firefight I duck behind a car to reload the freeze hits and by the time it's over their standing over me unloading a clip. The roulette choice of weapons is not random you will never get any type of weapon unless you pay a certain amount.",4
"So I recently redownloaded the game, and every time I go into the call of duty, log in button, it takes me back to the Activision logo, and doesn't let me log in so I'd like some help with that, and if I do get the help, I need this review will go up by 4",1
"Best game I'll play for my time pass I've played many more battle royal games pubg , free fire , iam last 4 year playing free fire but now I slowly stoping because phone hanging waste of top up.. but call of duty much much good game every try .....üíûüî•",5
unable to play!! keep gettimg a message when i log in that third part apps or plugins are prohibited but i am not using anything else. cant figure out why its doing this please fix this sucks!! what would you even use that would be prohibited?!?!?! #Outraged,1
The game is good it allows you to team up with good friends and even make new ones but the game takes a lot of storage,5
I can't give it more than 3 knowing how good it could be with better controller options. I have a razer kishi and have to bluetooth my Xbox controller for my kishi to work so I have to keep my controller with me so it doesn't die. I think it would be better if we did not have to carry an extra device,3
The ping issue is f***ing anynyoing.If you dont fix this and keep on trying to earn money by creating crates and stuff.Please concentrate on in game issues and listen to your players otherwise you will loose players rapidly,3
Great to play it contains great weapons such as the Mac 10 and much more One of the best franchises to still exist plus on mobile but it sucks that you can't send skins,5
"It's still fun, it's just glitchy now, and nothing really makes sense anymore. Just opened 4 epic crates in a row, and only got weapon xp cards. Some guy shot me through a wall across the map, but I couldn't shoot through a car window. It's just not good anymore. Im sure they will do better in the future, but this season is just such a disappointment. I'm just so sad now.",2
"Ok game,flight suit doesn't work right and don't care how much armor you're wearing, but in real life if you get hit by a car or truck 3 times, You shouldn't be able to hold a gun let alone shoot me.Also you need to give a better advantage to a player who gets the drop on another player.Too many times I've been killed by shooting someone in the back.Tom Clancy would be ashamed.The gap between bots and players is magnanimous. Nice try, to much fantasy stuff, u can't jump on a vehicle at fullspeed",2
Give us some low graphics that I can play this game in my vivo v9 pro when ever play this game my screen get freeze even this game give a low graphics then also it's happen give us more low graphics that I can play this game.,3
"I put 5 star coz its really good game,but wen it freezes on me it gets on my nerves. But now its saying that the wifi server isnt stong when it is strong and it wont work on my phone. It dnt need updating yet. It works on my ipad but not my phone",5
Great game only problem I have is why does my game freeze for a sec or two right when I'm about to shoot in battle royale? Gets me killed all the time,4
My account got hacked and someone daily changing the username and using my CO. I've already linked with Activision and Play games. Contacted customer care via the cod app sadly no use at all they are all dump. Now I have stopped playing cod moved to APEX LEGENDS. But still love the pc versions. Cod mobile is not doing its job.,1
This is a mobile platform adaption of OG series Call of duty. This game is hyperrealistic and overall good playing experience.,5
"I have played thousands of fps and royale games but this one ,this one is one in a million Its basically one of the best games i have played in life i.e on mobile I would give 5 stars if you fix lag, bugs and glitch",4
This is a really fun game and the weapons are very good and the graphics are amazing üòéüòéüòé. And you can play with your friends and the gus are op. If you like one on one combat you will like these game.,5
"I find it particularly unsettling that the visuals for the game differ from IOS and Android services when it's Google play. Just saying where's the comradery between developers. Overall this game is epic, on a mobile scale of course.",4
Great when it works. Gets stuck on the loading screen now since the most recent update.,2
"Ranking system is absolute garbage, even worse, if you want to lose your sanity i recommend you this game, plus if you have wifi problems and it dissconects you, they dont even give you the rejoin match option and the take away 80 points from your rank points and give you a ranked ban, if i could i would rate this game 0/5 but i cant",1
The game is really good. But there are many problems too. Like sometimes in between the game it asks for logging in which is really annoying specially in ranked matches for which we lose. Also sometimes the game starts from middle of a match when the our is losing and this results in losing ranked xps as we can't even leave the matches. One more problem is that it shows disconnected from server when my screen times out which results in losing xp points. But overall its a great experienced.,3
"This game was a great game, now it's always lagging and freezing up. Am not spending a dollar more on this game until the bugs are fixed",1
Downloading the new update today but as of yesterday with a brand new phone from Motorola the game consistently crashes a lot of the times while in match but very specifically every time I go to download the maps or camos for guns it crashes no matter what it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when,2
After zombie update I cannot play it. It stays white or black and I can't do ANYTHING on my tablet except exit. I'm deleting but would love game cuz i went out of my way to make room for update and what do I get? Nothing. Fix it and I will love the game again. Ok you fixed it and I am a man of my word. I like it a lot anyways but now that I can finally play it again I actually enjoy it now. Thank you so much.,5
"Ngl I love this game! I'm not having any issues üòåü§òI've been playing this game for like a month an I'm already at the end of the level point, been playin 24/7 !!! Thank you cod mobile creator !!!",5
The games hella good but I kinda hate that when you delete it you have to update it and a lot of other stuff but overall the best game I've ever played on mobile that's a shooting game,5
"It's a really fun game but my map is all glitched in the top right it just had the corner of the map but it's really big so it gets in the way, wondering if they could fix this?",3
"It's fun, and addictive, amazing game ! Don't like some updates when I'm unable to play for a while,have to download about everything",3
Not working after update have tried to delete and reinstall more than once after load in login screen after the icons for Facebook guest and Activision acct disappear from screen it freezes,5
The new update sucks. And the bots suck. It seems as the game has went down hill in the last year. So much lag.,1
Hey cod developers I have a new featured mode for you hear me out it's like gun game but a random weapon class is selected the more kills you get the better attachments appear on the gun they can also be a combination like domination first team to 50 kills gets to vote on the next weapon class majority rules then it's first team to 100 kills to win I had a dream about this mode last night had to post it probably not going to happen but still a cool idea,5
"Best mobile shooting game, I love the game, but the problem is the update, is too high and it consume much space.",4
Nothing but scripted characters completely fake. Only chance for a fair battle to to make private matches and play with your friends good luck great graphics,2
Terrible On The Fly Manipulation and with players allowed to play a Mobile game on PC. Don't waste your time with this. Play Modern Combat 5 instead.,1
I installed the new cod(sn5) update only for it to be lagging behind keeps on saying that there is a problem with the connection server,2
The game became so frustrating as after short time from downloading it stops working and gives me a warning so I must redownload it to work again.. this issue happened to me several times üò† put the game is very very good üôÇ,5
"The new update was stolen, I wait for 7 hours at high speed, and when it reaches the end, it gives me an error, when I go to other games, damn you, thief",1
"I'm getting kicked out of games and its frustrating! I've been uninstalling and installing to try to fix it, put the graphics on lowest setting, made sure my internet connection was good even before opening the app, but every game I get kicked out and have been penalized when I play Ranked! Its come to the point where I cannot even play ranked anymore for fear of getting kicked. I can't play my best or get MVP because of this. I'm using a Samsung S10. IPhone has problems like this too! Pls help",2
I could not play this game in peace. Whenever I start playing frames and my internet service disgusts me without cooperation. I don't want to play anymore. Thank you for traveling with me for the last two years of my life! Good Bye!,1
"Even on a high end device with good wifi, this game lags alot, and ping spikes all the time...almost unplayable at this point",4
Best of the best. Played all the others and this is by far the best. I don't rate games but this the 1st game I really enjoy playing. The MP Rank games are equally ranked no other game has that.,5
After update watching ads options is vanished.. why this happens?? How do i get it back ..in my game lobby .. it was available in last season but after update it is not their .,5
"The update has made it a lot smoother and more optimized but that's about it. You should really be concerned about some things that might be ruining the interests of the players (Ahem, persistence) and I know you have your own reasons but could you please at least make it so that you can only use persistence and not pair it up with hardline. Other than that, the game is at a pretty good point and I hope you all the best.",4
I'm the best ever. I cant play with my mobile hotspot. Doesn't load the game..other games work as well as other apps. I miss this game..was so fun.,1
I have updated upgraded and downloaded several times at 1.53 gig at a time. But it still doesn't update. Ate u guys going to pay me back for my data,1
"Best game,graphics and controls are on another level üò≥ while playing..feels like playing a pc game on mobile",5
This is really cool but My enemy Is so strong always i cant Win in ranked i can only win in Multiplayer they Always put me To a strong enemy i cant win 2 star this made me mad and Always Getting out of mood,2
"The best shooting game that you can get. Great graphics and super fun game modes its online theres ( Battle Royal , Multiplayer ,Rank Match and a zombie gamemode ) try it its super fun and i recommend you to download it Im also from south africa. The graphics of the game on high is so smooth the game's quality is so good. Ive never got any problems with the game for the past year. Im saying to again i recommend you to download it and to be in that community. Call of Duty for daysss (Huge fan)",5
"I love this game I really do But I don't know the kind of update you guys used in this game, that update ruined everything.please am begging you guys to restore this game back cus it's really annoying And I can't be spending money buying legendary weapons and still be suffering",3
"This game became so fake. They add too much of special abilities and it comes out that whoever pay real money they dont put any effort like people who played it since day 1. I hate it as soon as i start playing i get a glitch, frozen moments, like somebody on purpose breaks into your game and disables you. I shoot the guy in a head he is not dying and im level 150....... i waste whole 30 bullet ammunition he is still alive. He puts 1 damn bullet and im dead......seriously...???!!!",5
I am very disappointed this used to be so fun and enjoyable but now so many bugs and the game crashes after the update.üò°üòì,1
The massive amount of memory this game takes is insane its almost 20 gb .. and it's slowing my smart phone. Might just have to delete the game,3
"Anyone that is having any issues should first look at there phone or connection!! I don't have any issues playing the game for several years (huawei p30 pro), occasionally a bug after a update but that's normal and fixed asap. About the game it self: it has s√≥ much to offer, all the best modes and weapons from the COD franchise!! Quality is great and everything keeps improving. This is why the game size is so big and ITS WORTH IT! I have one issue: skin prizes are too expensiveüòîI wont buy them",5
I am disappointed that the game is struggling to connect to my controller. I did research and this problem is going a while on,1
"To many loading screens, game closes automatically and I keep losing 80 points in ranked. Fix your game",1
Whoever created the matchmaking algorithm is crazy man. Most of the time it gives newbies hardcore players.,4
"This game is starting to get on my nerves. So much raw files to download. Just now I tried to update it,, they said 1.54 GB, now they're saying 2.56 GB!!! Its annoying to the core",1
The game still says connected to server or check your network even if my net speed is at 15mbps please fix this problem if you change that layout to to be simpler but not too simple great game experience and also make it support lower-end devices like my mid-range phone on higher graphics.the audio pretty bad too I wish that you could to make the audio very clear,4
The game keeps crashing after the new update. Keeps showing the error 'Download configuration failed',2
The game is good just the part where we have to download resources for guns that we all ready have and also having to download the map for br but it's actually a very good game,5
"I've been a COD player since COD4. The last couple of years I have not enjoyed the console CODs until modern warfare 2019. That being said for me, COD mobile is just as good just in a mobile platform. UPDATE: I'm glad they added zombies again but it's not the original it used to have so... 4 stars. I'll let it slide",4
Pumped is broken: doesn't always recharge The acceleration delay on vehicles is murder Why does the wingsuit range change between updates ? The invisible barriers alongside roads are also murder Good work nonetheless,4
"I have been playing call of duty for past few years in my PC and I never expected that I could play on my phone.... The gameplay is so smooth, amazing graphics , no glitches... This Game is Awesome and so Addictive.",5
The game is soo nice it is realistic and controls are very easy and it's easy to deafetthe enemies,5
I do not recommend playing this game with slow or even normal wifi. This game was and still is a very good experience to me and it is one of the best multi-player game out there,5

It's millions of shooting games. But none can compare to CALL OF Duty point blank period. In fact if I was a shooting game maker I would just stop üõë. ü§£ü§£üíØ,5
Hey it's a good game and all but I was wondering if you could make more levels in undead siege so it could be more difficult and more zombies thanks,5
"There are no ads, It super fun to play with friends and they are constantly getting new modes to play. I would say that the only downside is it drains so much phone battery. ( At least for my phone)",4
The best game I have played in my life...usually a game becomes boring after a while but this one doesn't....I always look forward to playing this game....please download u won't regret,5
Please add support for 120hz on redmi note 10 pro. Game has been out for years and still 120hz is not supported on my device. Apex just launched and has support for me. Stop playing Codm,3
This update is much better then other its very smooth and fun to play. The best part is it has very less bugs.üôÇ,5
"The game is great i love the game alot its just that its too much GBs and my phone cant handle it and with all the updates and maps,weapons to download it just takes alot of GBs but overall a good game",3
"Excellent graphics and game play , another big map just like the br isolated is needed and will be awesome . A big of lagging issue after new updates . Overall good but could always do better .",5
"Its a worthy game to play.The only problem is that it drops my fps except that everything is brilliant and surely u can download it maybe not the best shooter game for low end mobile.But,its worth playing üôÇüôÇüëç.....",5
"This app seems to get larger every updateü§îTakes up too much space. This is my Favourite game and I love playing CODM so much, I also hope for increasing level because I already maxed it",3
Since the new update last night game won't load past the intro screen no matter which option you use to try log in it doesn't work,1
There has to be a way to skip that boring tutorial. Make it easier to skip & log in. I have multiple devices & am tired of the tutorial for a game I know how to play...,1
"Average gameplay but new season has spiked the ping, lag has not been reduced at all and bugs have not been removed, for example the right fire button perspective fixed does not work properly. Please fix this.",3
"This is so far the best survival game av played nd actually the only game av rated ever The graphic, weapons and vehicles re so realistic nt to mention the exceptional gameplay",5
It is a nice game and the new update is superb quality and try to put ultra graphics settings too it will be super to play with ultra graphics ü•∞,5
"After the last update, there is a problem with the sound, while I'm using the headsets I can't hear a thing, the sound is disrupted...too bad, the game is the best I've ever played on mobile...",2
It's an amazing battle field game and has good graphics... the only problem I have with it is the storage consumption,5
"Personally I'm having a great experience with the game .. it feel up to date, especially when you have a external controller üî•",5
"It is a really great game I love it, but now that the new season 3 has come out it says I can't update the app because of not enough storage, I have deleted everything I could down to like 4 apps including the apps that won't let me delete. I don't know if I will be able to play the game anymore but I really want to because the game is amazing. Is you have any suggestions to what I should do please tell me",2
The game's good but you're put against players that buy everything which kills the fun every time. Sad but after 5 years I'm uninstalling the game.,1
We need something new and exciting for Battle Royale probably a bigger map and a few other things.... also graphics update & fps.....,5
"Good experience but What happened to bundles in this game frl üòí. Even if they came back it should be renewed every day or two, not a month.",4
A very excellent game but the main problem is that we arent abel to get legendary draws at the first or second draws always last this costs a lot of our money!!üò¢,5
Connection losses. Game becomes oblivious for several seconds during a match. Extremely irritating.,1
When you are approach an enemy the Latency going high and not able to play now. Fed up of this please fix this latency issue ASAP.,2
I can't see it on my Pixel 4a. The fonts are too small. I can see that WarAfter is a total ripoff of this game though.,2
My experience is getting worse everyday. My ping sky rockets and I'm pretty sure it's from y'all's end. And then my analog takes control BY ITSELF. I've had my camera view spin on its own. I mean is y'all's a.i. attacking me or something cuz other games play great. I'm tired of this. Please fix it...,3
This game is amazing. It's fun and the matchmaking is almost perfect. Although this game does take up alot of space.,5
There's a lot of problems like the knives are two LP they make you run fast and they're an instant kill they need to be nerfed but overall it's a good game so I give it a 4 out of five because there's more room for improvement,4
I'm starting to hate this game because I've deleted everything and I can't update it and I can't delete any other app plus my account would kick me out most of the time and I loved this game back then I'ma just delete it thanks for the great 3 years of playing,1
Update stopping at 100% and not moving forward. Tried downloading 2 times with the same result. Jan 2nd 2022,1
Legendary. Perks and scorestreaks have changed which is stupid and unorganised can't have what you want only what it says the whole layout for this new update has ruined my whole cod gameplay thanks Activision for ruining cod.,5
One of the best mobile FPS games to exist so far. Not as good as the PC or Console versions but that comparison is irrelevant.,5
I am fan of call of duty I played every single series of call of duty in PC but in mobile this one spacial I love it so much this is the best fps game I've had ever seen Thank you Activision for making beautiful games,5
This game is the best it's so cool the graphics are incredible and the sound affects absolutely smashing game well done creators you did so well,5
"Controller support doesn't work, says I'm connected but doesn't connect. Rip had a good time",1
"A bit funky with the frame rate sometimes, and tends to lag a small amount but overall not bad",4
"Games not bad just the ppl who play it, not all of them of course but the ppl who treat pubs like it's ranked gets annoying very fast I can't even casually grind camos bc you have ppl tryharding in a pub match",3
This is the best ever shooting game i have ever seen in my hole life. I play gta vice city/max pain?Igi cover strike/far cry /modern combat. But still i love this game very much because the game grafics is awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
When i am open the game it gave me error that there was an error during the download from play store but this error comes from last 2 days earlier game was working fine.,2
"Good game, ive spent money also to the game but now i cant log in. It Always says loading timeout or timeout. You shoud fix this issues may people have spent time and money to your game.",3
"Alot of glitches and server issues, keep getting closed in middle of the game, cannot start the game, it says no internet connectivity, tho I'm using 5g wifi",1
"Cool game I didn't get any crashes plyaing it but when updating like 2 gb instead of making it on the playstore or at least run in the back ground, I have to wait till the update is done stuck in the loading screen",3
Amazing! I play this Cod more than the ones i have for my Xbox one. Edit: still play every chance i get and love everything about the game EXCEPT the amount of tiers available and the fact that it takes up damn near 15gb of space. That's wild! My dumb @ss went and spent 150 on draws and got everything but the gun I wanted. Y'all really wanted me to spend 300 dollars for a gun. Crazy. About ready to delete this ish.,3
The game does not start. I shows some network error even though the device is connected to internet.,1
"I love this game. Just wish they would do more in the water. Underwater map, hidden chests. Something",5
"One of the most action and thriller multiplayer I have played on mobile. Although some slight issues here and there like game optimization is kind of bad, my phone is a decent one but it still lags.",3
"I've had a 5 star review since November 2019, but the latest update has caused a bug that crashes the game during EVERY BR match, and always either kills me in the blue zone or freezes right as I'm in a fight. Kinda hard to improve stats when the game is your biggest opponent. Fix the bug and I'll be happy to bring back 5 stars",5
Best Game Ever in History of Mobile Gaming... I'm basically not a Mobile gamer... I'm a PC gamer and I've been a fan of OG Call of Duty PC's Games But... When I discovered CODM... It's Just Awesome... I'm glad Activision Did this‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•,5
Good game overall butt it's way too big a game like it's 17GBs mlb9inings has been around longer and it's less than 2GBs and Microsoft bought Activision Microsoft do something about it I had to delete basically all my games for this update update anyways I hope an employee sees this,4
Game keeps shutting off on me in Battle Royale. It hardly ever seems to do it when it's a quick multiplayer match but you get me in Battle Royale and I'll have to re-log in three four times a game üëé. I was seriously thinking about putting money into this game but I just can't do it when it's kicking me out all the time.,4
Game is good but there is one problem . In two matches my kills were more than in my teammate but why he had became MVP in that match. If you want I can share screenshot also.,1
Great graphics and gameplay it resembles the console MP very well. BR has some issues though.,5
Love the game. Except there isent any sound anymore I can't here the guns going off or the sword swing. That's what I need back.,3
"I was updating this new update a few hours ago, on 100% it stops and show can't update app and my full update data gone and it is showing update again. I will not update it again.",2
"This game is good,graphics is good whenever I'm sad I play this game to make me happy.The season 5 update is very cool it gives free skins in the event. I can never forget CODM,CODM is my favorite game.",5
"I only give this a 1 because there's no -20 option. Yes it's fun, but all the BS downloading 12,045MB on top of the GBs is overkill. Too much BS for too little fun. Honestly I would love to play this day in and day out, but the amount of time spent on getting updates, downloads and re-downloads, makes me very sad and so infuriated!",1
"I love this game it has amazing graphics and you're able to play against people somewhat around your level or skill. The only problem I have now is that I can't log back into my main acc. I've tried to reinstall the game, clear the cache, and restart my phone. It still says authorization error.",4
"Coustome vehicle controls in ground war does not work, time to kill is way too short, and does not accept Google play credit never spending money on this game agen till this issue is fixed",1
Best game ever . Fully satisfied with it . I can't say that this game is for FREE coz of it's graphics . Best mobile game .,5
"The latest update was a big flop Enemies do not appear until they start shooting at you when using Special skill with regard to K9 unit after releasing the tomboy you can't revert to the weapon you were using, there will literally nothing on your hands when insted of announcing K9 units incoming character will be saying cover me reloading",3
I love the game and all that but there a problem the new update that just lunched when i click update it only goes to 100% it does not show instaling or updateing please fix it i dont i can play the game agian:(,4
There was a time when this game used to run on 2GB update.(along with user data and downloads). Now BOT developers have provided 14GB unnecessary in game download data to increase lag and bugs. Call of 16GB is in progress with next update. #Delete this game.,1
My internet speed is enough to play any video on YouTube in 720 p....but still this game shows timeout....it's just disgusting....,3
It's the best game in mobile history I will give it a 5 stars beacause this has very good graphics but some problem is that it always give me a timeout so I'm mad at that üò° please make the games for middle east and thank u,5
Make a lite version of cod mobile it very heavy to play on 4gb ram smartphones. Lot of lags and frame drop facing on low setting as well.,3
"Earlier the game was good with first aid kit. Please Fix the Game mechanics, you do not get heal when outside the zone. Many Died when trying to take the dog tag out of the zone. Making the game un-playable. Change it , then I will re-install and play the game.",1
"I play on my Samsung Tab A7 10.4. Since the latest update to Android 11 one ui core 3.1 I have been experiencing several Graphics issues while playing Battle Royale on any map. My field of vision is very limited when it comes to opponents, meaning it doesn't load their graphics if they're are more than 20 or more feet away and they could see me which gets me killed in the situation I would not normally get killed. The weapon and loot pickups look like boxes instead of actual weapons. Pls update",1
I have been playing this game for over 2 years and keeps getting better and better I love all of the call of duty I even play on Play station and Xbox,5
I thoroughly enjoy they game. Yeah sometimes there are cheaters but whatever. Would give four stars but the bots drive me nuts. 2 shots and you're dead. Oh well. Still fun,3
Gives a best gaming experience in mobile But only the problem Is the cod points cost tooo high . Only the rich can buy it .not all the pro players can afford it .only the rich can.plz codm there are so many pro players love this game . Plz decrease the price amount of cod points . Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
Im having problems loging into my account. This the second time im just logged out of the game.Previously my level in the game dropped to level 1,1
its an amazing ballte royal game it has perfect low graphic and its a best game i had ever played even pubg is not has this type of graphic üòéüòéüëçüëçüëçüëç But I found some glich in this game when I play for first time every day I get in to the match in middle of the file,5
"It's are very damn good game. The controls are easy to use while playing online matches, you can change the game controls through controls settings for more comfort. Rating this game out of 5 star's üëè",5
"Amazing 100 percent one of the best mobile games I've ever played highly recommend, theres only one problem it takes up to much storage .",5
I love this game. Call of duty is one of my favorite games. I am very surprised that Activision made a CALL OF DUTY that you can play on mobile!,5
"Truly love the gm, similar to console play and controls are easy. My only issue is the price of everything. You buy the battle pass for 25 but then can spend upwards to 200 trying to unlock characters n special guns. That's alil excessive to do that every month, but obviously you don't want to miss out on certain things but after $100 your hesitant to spend anymore money. Please find a better way for us so we can enjoy the game fully without constantly breaking the bank",4
"I have played almost all of the COD games and this is one of my favorites I love the graphics, the controls, and the game play.",5
An amazing game with so many awesome choices of modes and they're are all awesome and I have nothing bad about this game I would like to say.,5
Never glitches for me. Great graphics and audio. You don't have to spend a dollar to be a baller. Nough said.,5
Not boaring because of new places in multiplayer mode... I üíïüíï always this. It's better than pub g and free fire.. keep it up.,5
The graphics are super good every thing I perfect but sometimes the game kicks me ad when I put my Gmail account it does not work.,5
I don't know why I can't download the latest update of this game I've used my data for like six times now and after thr download it keeps telling me I can't download after my data almost 6GB gone what's wrongüòíüòíü•≤,1
Very bad experience for updating the game.. I m used my almost 2.5gb data for update new season... But the ending download fail & showing re download üôè,1
Very addictive. I play BR to unwind after a long day. I like how interactive this game is. Only catch is the amount of memory it uses! And the occasional force stop. It also takes precedence over my music.,4
Update: Mt Google account was connected and had all my saved info on the app. Now it Google doesn't show up anymore? Any update on that? 05/25/2022 Fun and addicting,4
"Size of the app is a great problem ,other like other apps this one has 12 gb . If there is something that you could do to reduce the size please do it üôè.",5
I love the game but recently I haven't been able to play it keeps saying things about my network when I get in a game an I can't see anybody or play the game could you pls help,3
Once it was too much good. I am playing this game from it's launching date. After so many updates now it's file size is too big and so many complexity has added. So many bugs and issues. It's very sad that you wanted to improvise but you have downgraded the game.,2
"Excellent app I've been playing for years, only niggle is the amount of updates, don't think I've spent money on the game but get decent game play, so all good from me.",5
"Here is an honest review. I've played many mobile games in my life and I've come to say there hasn't been any war like game that is better than CoD, I won't lie,disadvantages of slow frames when playing against overseas players come as annoying and the fact that the game demands more space,beats up the phones CPU therefore a good phone is needed, that's all because of the game is at its best before the upcoming update. Communication between players üíØ... just download nd come join a proud player",5
"Hi, this is a very interesting and creative game, but I have a problem. I am playing on a blue stack Android emulator on my computer. My account has been blocked for 10 years. I tried to send a message of support on the website, but unfortunately there is no email for support. I also created a few new accounts. They have been blocked for a few minutes. Please check this issue and consider a section for problems inside the website. Thank you.",5
I've grown slightly apart from cod but it's still my favorite. I've seen the videos for seasons 5 and it looks sick. Hopefully I can get the mythic oden lol,5
"Almost perfect in the start, but as u get to level 4, matchmaking gets really unfair. You have to play against level 12 or 13 players. No other problems anyway, great game!",4
"This game is great considering it is a mobile game! BR is great, MP is also great and really fun to play. My favourite is hard point shipment.",5
Edited from 2 to 4 stars. The issue was resolved but few glitches still there so keeping it to 4 stars.,4
Finally works and I must say I am impressed gameplay is good with a really good connection still testing the waters will update with a little more time with the gameUpDATE works great at times other times no so much still fun to play but need a good phone with only this game on it. Cause it takes up alot of space still sticking with my 4 stars though.UPDATE #2: game takes up enormous amount of space now this is only game on phone because of that,4
Enjoyed this game until the new update now my controller Setup is completely wrong and And parts of it will not work I still think it's a good game but probably won't play until this is fixed,4
"Trash game imo. You guys don't want to fix your servers,I keep getting connecting to server issues when my network is completely fine.I still don't know what's the point of updating the game when you can't even play it,such a waste of storage.",1
So much better then the console versions of cod I haven't even come across one toxic player and I've been playing for almost a week plus tons of content there's always something new to look forward to and that's something we don't get much of from games you would be missing out if you dont at least give the game a try!üòâ,5
"It isn't perfect, but it is far better than any other mobile fps. BUT *15* gigabytes with all resources! You've got to be kidding me!!!",5
One of the best phone games but lie all games it has its flaws and imperfections game lags when you come across real players in BR matches sometimes my controls will be acting up and my guy will run all on his own and shoot all on his own and switch weapons all on its own and sometimes your character won't be able to be hear by teammates so if you mark something or ping somewhere the ping won't show up and the character won't say whatever the call out is suppose to be,5
"It's like since the new season is here I can't even play with my Xbox one remote anymore, I'm a android user and it always worked but now I can't use it anymore, but iPhone users can use remotes fully with no problems. Pleas fix this",2
The game is very awesome and the is also very awesome. But there is a small problem it has too many updates it takes so much data .sometimes the game crashes .,5
To be honest this game is a very nice game special if ur device is good it will not lag and if ur device is not good it will lag so don't blame cod ur device is not good I've played many times and it never laged until u don't have a net problem if ur device is good and net too 100% it will not lag I've read many of them say bad things and many of them good,5
"Button has been disappearing during ranked matches, I've installed all updates and it hasn't happened until I got to pro in ranked. I've reported bug in game also.",1
"Love the graphics and the game, but wish it was a little more even ground for those that don't waste money for the game.",3
Great Game but little optimization for Samsung Exynos phones will better because other games like PUBG Mobile gives Extreme frame rate option but COD Mobile limit to High Frame rate only on same device. Device Name: Samsung Galaxy A50.,5
"Well, I got a new phone. I can not load my old character I have had a long time. To recover the character the game asks for access to my root directory, I can't gain access too. I have had a linked account for a long time and still no response from customer service. I have placed 4 attempts to recover the account, no response. Thank goodness I have a college background in business to understand this company doesnt care. Respond and help me correct this problem, please. This is getting silly.",1
It is really really cool and what I like about it is you can actually can schoose to shoot and at the beginning it is hard but after the beginning it is really fun,5
"Ranked match should have option to play SOLO. I don't like losing Even when I kill far more then the rest of my team. You basically can't win ranked if your friends are not professional gamers. So I usually play with random teammates, it feels like my team is usually full of bots with like 2-3 kills and 15-20 deaths. Non ranked Multiplayer is not challenging enough and Ranked multiplayer basically depends on luck. I don't play Battle Royale. I am at level 150 and legendary class.",3
In all honesty if the update takes more of my space I'll delete the game its getting annoying like I can't afford the next gaming phone like I'm here for a sweet game and out not play professionally like if this continues ill just delete it aside from that it's a good game,3
"In the game while in the final safe zone, my heart races... my senses awaken and i feel bliss and scared at the same time... how did i manage to reach upto this point? Will i be called out as the winner? Damn! The games is so amazing üëè",5
Game has become completely different. Better In allot of ways. But there are a few things that could be better. Like character skins for free that are actually something some people would want to add to their collection. Better gun skins for guns that aren't the same guns they keep buffing or making new skins for. And pls you gotta make some legendary weapons and operator's obtainable threw events. Even if we have to grind our asses off on the events. I mean events tho not running not a buy.,5
Awesome graphics and skins plus the effects are rad. Sadly though there are small glitches which get annoying,4
"I'm editing this at the start of season 5 and ending of season 4 and I have to say this game still does not run smoothly at all. There are a lot of bugs and the game crashes almost in every other game. Even for season 5 update, the developers have overlooked the crashing bug and the matchmaking in this game is utter nonsense with no sense of the players' ranks and stats whatsoever. You will get teamed up with the bots. I wish this review meant something but the developers just wanna make money.",5
No zombies is a huge let down. Would also be nice if the game didnt start before you get placed in the game. Weak support.,1
üëåget the game if u like killing ur friend and have fun btw cod mobile develop btw I have a problem when I play cod mobile the screen sometimes turn black but I can still move and I have to log out then joined again but by the time I do so I am dead please fix this It will mean a lot and also make the draws more better its a rip off that I spent 20 dallors and did not get a gun or charecter,5
"This game is pretty good but make the graphics more realistic like call of duty warzone ,modern warfare and cold war and please add the kar98k(mw) ,tec 9,cooper carbine from vanguard",5
"This is the best mobile game ever. So fun and instantly replayable. The graphics are amazing and how much variety you can have in weaponry is shocking. What makes this different than trash games like clash royale is that the matchmaking doesn't effect who wins the game. Maybe a person is higher level and has better weaponry, but they're still defeatable.",5
"I have been an avid player of the C.O.D. series for many, many years. My collection is extensive...with Call of Duty Mobile, my collection is complete..thank you. However, the cheaters/hackers are getting way out of control..you need to pay more attention to keeping the game pure, and stop worrying about skins and such... ...If they gotta hack to play, then they're not worthy to play...",4
this game is my place really competitive and if you can crawl your way to higher ranks the game is that much better nothing but skill can help matches get super intense and only the strongest survive,5
I gave this game one star because I login my COD Account and enter a match but my match won't play. It just load and automatically kicks me out or show game end.....,1
Amazing!!!!! Don't like the console game but mobile is definitely my favorite favoriteest mobile game to play by far... now if only there was a guitar hero mobile...,5
"Whenever I go to play games, I have to download something, I do not like it or I am going wrong, how much MB is getting our loss , you should think about it.ü§î",3
"Update on this .. can't beat it for the top mobile shooting game next to pub G, controller support is based on what you use but other than that it's hands down a great game",5
If you dont have the most best service then this game is not for you it lags even with my hi speed internet .with full bars and i been play from seasion 1 and every update for new one lags bad for the first week till they get there stuff all stright.and stop with the updates every 30 days.,5
"I really enjoy the game, but the storage needed for installing the app is very high along with an update over 1GB. I understand new maps and weapons have to be added now and then to keep people interested. But unfortunately it will be my last update",5
this is not cod og.. new guns are way more powerful compare yo old og guns. matchmaking is always pro player 1 side and u and bots are on others sides. and others sides prize guns is like official hack just fire 2 3 shots and boom...so bye bye cod..not recommended...,1
"I've only problem which is this game prefer at least 4//6/8/12 GB ram for Android mobile, processor should become SD up to 700. This type of configuration device not possible to carry for middle class family. If it's possible to make the game under 1gb like before, I think it'll very easy to play with medium or less than medium configuration device. Still now it's very tough to play on redmi y3 device..!! Thank you.",5
Badass game (updated review). So I've bought a few things in game for money with no issues. But now I purchased 2 smaller items and I did not receive them. Contacted support and it's been nothing but hassle. It's like they refuse to just give me what I paid for after providing more than enough obvious evidence of the mistake made on their part. They will keep this 1 star rating until its resolved,1
"I have ""Ask before downloading"" checked and ""Automatically download viewed items"" unchecked. And I still get nonessential assets auto downloading",4
"Its a well and fun game but a large downside this app has had for its entire lifespan is the account system being really iffy and confusing. Lost my progress from a season 1 or 2 account, and cant get my old account back. Tried activation support, but it was either not there or needlessly complicated to where it was basically hidden. If I could get some help to recover my old account or even just migrate the data to a new one, it would be very appreciated.",3
Since I first day I have loved it and still do to this day was a big glitchy at first but now I believe you have all the bugz worked out love it love it love it. Doesn't hurt since I've upgraded my phone either,5
"After the last update, I cannot ADS i cannot shoot, it requires pressing multiple times to make the button work",1
"Everything is perfect in this game. I just love it. We can play and at the same time we can communicate with our friends. I suggest everyone to play cod instead of pubg. No hate for pubg just the graphics are better in cod. One thing I want back is Health kit, Adrenaline, different level vest. Except this thing everything is perfect.",5
Hi bro this is the best game in world i have ever played this is a very good game but sometimes if you could give a legendary skins of guns a year for free it would be very good otherwise it is the best game after gta5 and gta5 I know you would not read my review but I am saying true,5
This game is fun and have a good graphics but the problem is the game size is increasing update by update! My tab can't handle it!! Do something,2
Game still very good. But something issues are really irritated. So i will request to Call Of Duty Mobile please solve these some networks issues...,4
"It's very good don't get me wrong, but I put one star to put you attention on the fact that every weapon that I gotten to diamond tear always gets stuck on diamond tear at 2000-2040 and its pissing me off, so fix it please",1
I love to play music while I game so I load up a match and then I go to turn on the music and when I get back after like 3 min and it says the match is over so I click leave butten and it says I'm banned for like 10 min,3
"This is a nice game, but the matchmaking is TERRIBLE. I'm either playing with people who can't hit the broadside if a barn, or a max level player with a godly setup and aim and movement that doesn't seem possible on mobile. And the teams are unfair at best, you might get good players that will carry you and wipe the whole team before you can even get a kill, or you have teammates that don't know what a gun is. It is hard to play on bad devices. But this is a nice game and I recommend trying it.",3
Don't know why but I just bought almost 600 cod points and the stupid app logged me out and Everytime I go to log back in it just restarts the game. Might wanna fix it.,3
"Good graphics, and controls are nice üëç i really enjoy it i actually play it almost 4 days a week but needs cool upgrades",4
9000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Love it so mutch but the crates is hard to get skins you must make it so that we can choose wat we want,5
The updates keep on coming on and on! Every update is 1.5gb. Plus they reset my rank in the new update from Master to Elite. Useless.,1
"The previous season was better as it did not have the air bombing, the air bombing is killing the fun we all used to have due to continuous unwanted sound",4
This is the best game of all i love to play since its launch and the graphics are unbelievable ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èBut sometimes it lags in my phone no problem the game is aaaaawwwwwsssoomüòä,5
"Ever since I updated it is not opening at all, it is showing crashes again and again can you fixed this problem",1
I am experiencing issues with it shutting down mid map download. Seriously frustrating especially when I have full service and can't play a level without that map. Also the controls are garbage as was stated by someone else. I hit fire and nothing happens. Get it together,1
Update the new season has been dreadfull this time the frame second is so slow the hole season has not suited my a7 Samsung can see the slow in the frame rate novel the game please help fix you have in the past thank you Same again- Keeps crashing in BR Update it started working for 2 weeksn and has started crashing even worse twice in a game nowBattle royal crash and audio issues I have reported it multiple time I love the gale but you guys just dont fix the issues a7 samsung phone.,2
"Good game, will get boring quickly if not played with friends. Also bring back classic zombies. Undead siege is not fun.",3
Love the game its great but since the recent update it freezes apon log in i even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game please fix this or my rating will go down,3
It's very fun and it's really good. Well I mean it is call of duty. I got so good at it that I got 156 kills in 10 vs. 10. Try call of duty mobile,5
"It's gud, though we should see the damage Armour plate being thrown out so we have the full experienceüòÇBest game ever. If there are any rewards for rating this my gamertag is 'De√Ñth' and PUBG is not better than CODM",5
"Call of duty mobile is so enjoyable game, it's very real and I believe it's amazing game. ‚òÜActivision team‚òÜ Thank you.",5
"After this last upgrade, this app logs me out and writes ""time out"" and its hard to login again afterwards. I have tried 8 good times to login it will process and take me back to ""time out"".......so anoying",2
Best multiplayer game I have ever seen Just one thing that there is lot of GB update comes every time and all downloaded things are resets ever time & that things takes much more GBs of net so please do something for that,5
"Hi , this update is 1.54 gigs to update , I spent 2 too update , then went in the game just to tell me I should update again the same update , and after a 4 gig that's gone nothing is updated I'm so passed off",5
"Definitely the most prolific first person shooter game I've ever played I was in the Army 11 Bang Bang Airborne Ranger, I can I can definitely feel the pressure when I play, where's there were more competitions where people could win money cuz it would be easy cash for me",5
Awesome game to play all new episode of the game it's pretty good.but why is the game always freeze and slow?and always loading time out or not joining the game at the moment.and I don't no why?but the game everything it's fine,5
One of the best thing about the game is when we have interest to play when we open the interface looks sooooo bad then we automatically close.....,5
The most and best game ever played.no words to define.provided ultra graphics and fps that no other game provided.worth characters as we pay as well as mesmerizing blueprints that make us feel we are in another world of gaming .such an amazing game.hats oof to Activision ü•≥ü•≥,5
"wish there was a way to get a weapon with a kill effect without spending 250$ ,which collectively I've probably already spent that much in game ,'as is..",4
"Playing this game for literally 2 and a half year is no joke and tha game feels much better ever time they release an update, the fast pace play style feels that this game is made for me üëçüëç",5
"This season 5 update is so worse and trash. havelots of bugs ,glitches new eventas have lots of glitches my karambit(deep water event) is glitched skin not showing Even I reached grandmaster 2 cod gives bot lobby ""WHY"" now everyday, every battle pass going cod gives trash skins",1
"The game is one of the best in call of duty franchise.my only issues are: matchmaking,like sometimes it takes ages to get a match started and ofcourse they can do better by removing the glitches and reducing the lag issues in the the game.",5
Wish you can make it to where the legendary blueprints can be earned by completing missions and etc. It sucks you have to pay over 100 just to get one,4
Fantastic game. COD really has their stuff together mobile wise. Although I have a ton of available memory on my phone and $15 to spare for a battle pass.,4
"Easily the best game I have ever played. The game is very well optimised and the graphics are top notch. Multiplayer mode is what makes this game, in my opinion, the best.",5
"Almost a perfect game but it takes too much data and idk why update comes every day and it also takes much Storage as I deleted my roblox (I have it on my laptop) and ff max and snap homework , and not for installing just for updating so it's a request pls make small updates",4
"For some reason in this season (S5) during almost every Alcatraz gameplay, I get sent with an assault rifle but with light ammos üíÄ so basically I don't have spare heavy ammos when I get revived it's quite problematic tbh",5
This 1 year anniversary update is the worst thing to happen to this game. Its terrible. Unistall until after this rubbish event is over.,4
It is an amazing game. But why isn't it allowing me to change my name? It is again and again showing nickname is encrypted. Please fix this. Is cod not concerned about its players?,4
Good game as I have played in the 4gb ram phone also now I play in 6gb ram but problem is that there is a lot of downloads inside the app if you wish to download otherwise also you can play if you download all the things inside game then game size will be 14gb and more as my experience is here the game is best i think as I am playing from day 1 of release. Must try!.,5
In the lower levels it's a lot of fun ... But there are too many cheaters in the upper levels especially in the ranked matches . So I don't recommend it to anyone .,1
"Good game. But recently Devs haven't been putting the needed attention to what players think. There are many imperfections in graphics. Despite this, whole game takes more than 10 GBs. I had to delete this game. Best game rn tho.",3
if there is less than 1 star i would pick it. Worst game pay to win and many cheaters based. It was a good game but now it is the most stupid game ever. 90% of players either use game consoles (which supposed to be a mobile game) and 90% of players also cheat using hacks for penetration auto-aim bots wall hacks and never dies you don't know how. And they do nothing about it.,1
This game is unplayable the past few seasons they need to fix the fps drop when engaging real players like seriously first I thought I had this problem but now everyone is having the same issue so I will give it 2 stars for that,2
Ranking makes no sense. No matter what my rank is I run into players that are absolutely terrible in the same match that I am with players that are way better than me. It makes this game incredibly frustrating to play.,1
What happened all of a sudden... now the game lags due to server issues... before I do get 70+ Ms now I get over 150...I lose matches because of that and the need to download resources over again is too much...now the game is just annoying.,2
My call of duty have not been working for 2 days now nobody is saying that there is a issue with the servers or game so I dont know why I can't even go in the game it keep saying there was an error during the Google play download idk how to fix it and I put so much work into this game I hope it gets fixed soon.,1
"""Unraked MP matches"" Are like scripted hollywood theme, takes unpredictable turns and ends up pretty surprising. That is really bad. Respawn locations are random at times to keep the play tough or easy as decided by the game. This is really bad.",5
"Great gaming design..... But for pass two days it won't open , it forces close and goes to main phone screen... üò£‚òπÔ∏è. Realized it does this rite before an update on the game is due.... But great game... I binge play .. thanks for making such a great game!!!!!!!!!",5
It was a great game played it everyday got almost everything but they dont show your kills anymore insted it gives you a rateing after every match so they can hide the bots and scam you to belive the matches are more even. Pathetic. Not knowing how meny kills i got makes the game pointless. will uninstall if not fixed,1
Matchmaking is the worst in this game. I won 3 matches and then all I was getting were trash teammates and I lost every single match after that. And the controls are awkward as well,1
I love this Game almost as much as I do the Original. It's a great game and I really enjoy it and I am recommending it to ALL whom are interested in a shooter above the test that will pass the test! Bar none.,4
"A ""Console-level"" FPS Game on the go. In my opinion it's a gaming experience better than both ""Garena Free Fire"" and ""PUBG Mobile"". I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS Games, or any other Action Games in general. The app itself uses a decent amount of storage, but It's worth a download if you have the extra space.",5
"So great and I've been playing on consoles, COD and, i love it so much, but I don't have much free time but when I do I'll come play. This game is great well organized plus easy controls so everything to me is smooth and fast. Awesome game indeedüíØ",5
I need some help. When I try to login in to cod and when I try to enter the game it shows an error message saying that I have no network when it works totally fine.,3
This my favourite game but after the last update the game lags too much. I have a nice internet speed but It still shows network error even sometimes it just logout me automatically plz solve the bug problems first and then give us a new update and so sorry for 1 star,1
"Can't See Players at Long Distance in BR I like to overwatch in BR with a sniper and was always surprised at the lack of players I would see in my scope. Then, one of my team members was fighting with another player and I could see my team mate, but not the other player. It was an open field, he was pretty far away from me, and it looked like he was shooting at nothing, but all of a sudden he killed the player and I couldn't see the other player at all. Do other people experience it plzrely",5
"Stunning, high-definition graphics accompanied by high-quality audio. Action-packed, with a wide selection of guns and awesome-looking characters!",5
"With this recent update it's impossible to start a game from beginning of a match, not ok. ""Everytime"" I begin a match it's half way done. Before update very easy to start a fresh match. Fix this",1
"Awesome game , amazing graphics . My only issue is to bring the normal classic zombies back , what we need all is the classic zombies.",5
"In world championship 2022 , for me it's matched up with enemies higher league then me. But my random teammates are quit the match and inactive on purpose, because of that I got only 56 points. Out of 10 matches I mostly MVP in all. But didn't qualify ,worst cod match ups ever. They match up noobs with me intensionally.",1
"I have been playing cod for 3 years never in my life I had this problem. But now after I connect my series x controller to codm I can only press the Y,X,A, and B button I can not move around or press the other buttons.",4
"Great game, incredible graphics and smooth running but extremely expensive when it comes to draws for legendary weapons be prepared to spend 100$ or more if your lucky.",4
I like the new update but since I updated my game after 2 days my when I open the game it's gives login error I try many times but still it won't let me login I uninstall and reinstall it many times but still after few days it's gives login error pls check and fix it ASAPüôè,1
It's a best game i had played ever it's graphic is as gta 5 I want to recommend you to download this game many people are playing this game their are to many modes such as team dead match and search and destroy and gun fight and many more. My favorite gun which I like is mx9 best gun you can gunsmith your gun their are many avtar in very good powers the price is very low you can buy it easy. One I tell you that cod is giving us gifts also I like this thing you can also buy a battle pass.,5
I love this game But please fix reconnecting bug It's very annoying every time it comes I have a very good internet connection.but I'm facing thus problem. This problem is faced by everyone please fix it.,2
This game is absolute trash on mobile. Not only do you have to download like a million things on it but the ping on this game is horrendous. Network speed is literally 90-100 Mbps yet I'm still stuck on 200 ping all the time. Absolutely ridiculous,1
"Used to be fun , but now each update makes the game worse . The world tournament didn't even work. Half of the people ik don't even get the special thing where you do things to gwt the little rewa rewards . Don't get it will just waist your time and if anything else doesn't all you'll have is the people who put lots of money into this game and you can barely do anything cuz you run out get shot once in the foot and melt . Any game mode you really like expect for it to only be there not even 7day",1
The game is great but there is one problem for me it keeps crashing so could you put a feature where it has less pixels so it doesn't overheating,4
Phenomenal! Amazing on the edge of your seat game play. Extremely fun to play. This game is by far one of the most stylish mobile games on the market. Such a masterpiece! Outstanding work developers...Just another day.,5
the game is good but the main thing is there are a lot of bugs and glitches everytime i start a match it says loading timeout and returns to lobby if you don't remove this bug or glitch ppl like me will give you 1 star ratings i cant even play a match,1
"My device could run at 60 fps and no overheating, now I can only get 20 fps and it overheats, please optimise the game for low end devices, you might see an increase in downloads and profit.",4
"I I like this Game. But in season 8 u guys increases the Ranking like,Grand master...why.??Its very hard.And Also Multiplayer very hard to Push the Legendary position. Why u guys doing like to us?So kindly next Season Don't increase the Ranking or Make a Good Multiplayer Experience Like Everybody can push in Legendary Rank.ln this Game and also Multiplayer make better Easier.Hope u guys will do..We are waiting for That update..",2
"Everytime i try to play i get kicked out with a ""authorisation error"" msg, i relaunched the app, cleared my cache as well as my data...and i STILL get the damn error...please sort this out.",1
"Here's the thing, stop focusing on colourful skins which doesn't even relate to COD theme just to make money. Focus on optimising your game and try to improve it. If you're taking money from players then atleast give some good experience for the gameplay. I can't even have a proper fight in BR because of your poor optimization. And if a gun can't compete with a better gun in BR then don't put it in loots. Just fill all the houses with only the top guns.Or maybe u shld jst remove d game frm store",1
I give 5 stars cause this version kills the series X version. Here I have a tip phone so I got rid of the series X and just use my elite controller to play on my mobile. Great game. And it actually works.,5
The game is becoming sweaty.Codm was better before and Ms is too high for me.Sometimes while fighting with enemies it lags and the next thing I am dead.Only those with good network and better phones have great advantage.I loved this game before.Atleast let's see some bots in mp rank matches since we are on disadvantages.I win 1 game than I lose the next 5 games.how do I play.Snipers are hard to play against since it is one shot one kill.Nerf sniper movements since it is one shot.,4
This game was so great back than this season just made it worse . Its so laggy and i can't play properly anymore. I even did that shade thing but same reasults. At least improve the lag again to better. it's just not working and its so hard to play now. I can't even play this game anymore. I hope season 11 will be better than this. i'm not happy with this game anymore..,4
Great game fun competitive. Many game modes to choose from most games you have to buy medpacks to heal or buy grenades to use them and there's a time limit? No rush great game action great sounds some maps a abit big for certain game modes overall Top marks!,5
"Every season i am fed up with same bugs(freeze/glitch). It is always happens in between playing BR Totally I fed up with this issue. All seasons I am reporting same bug. This time yet COD team can have no idea , how resolve this bug. Every time they are asking for bug details and I am always doing same thing.already I spends 20,000 Rs in this game. Actually I was really enjoyed this game. Now I am going uninstall this game, Else I needs permeant solutions for this bug. üòû",5
"One of my favourites to play with friends, strangers, or all alone. Get help, ask friends...or hit me up. One of the best communities of players, lots of action, AND highly customizable 1st or 3rd person shooter. See you in a match soon. .",5
I had fun while playing this game but now I don't know what the hell is wrong with it.. whenever there is an enemy nearby.. my ping hits 200 and I die like a bot.. I have spent a lot of money but it seems useless now.. huge updates and pathetic services,2
"Ever since the last update the game continually prevents me from logging in and displays timeout error everytime forcing me to sign in again,only to display the same error.The update really messed up the game",2
"Update March 29, 2022 Had to undownload, they destroyed the whole Entire game and movements. Added horrible cutscreen after every death, swapping weapons is awful now, character feels like a demented turtle or crab walking.. what in the world did you guys do to this game....",1
Controller isn't working with the game as of today's date. Worked yesterday and before. Not sure if the app needs a big fix or it's on my end but I've tried several times to get it to work.,3
It keeps showing an error of something like not lauched in ur area like that...m form India and I don't use any third party app. It has almost a year complaining about my issue but no action has been taken.,1
"This game is consistently taking up more and more space on my phone, like why? Honestly, this is a deal breaker cause now it takes up over 14gb of storage!! That's insane! Edit: now the new update has an error!",1
Would be better if I could just play with people who use their phone instead of PC or controller cause it's a super disadvantage but other than that game is amazing,3
"The game is great and I love it, but I can't enjoy it when I keep getting kicked out of the game after a round. If I could find a solution to solve this or it's a bug let me know something.",4
Seriously there are SOOOOO Many loading screens it's annoying I have to wait through at least 5 or more loading screens to even reach the menu. It's not a bad game but they Seriously need to do something about the loading screens,2
"Great game , i will give 5 star easy to learn and easy to control , full Action and i feel very good to play this . But some location i don't like, my favourite location is Kill House no body kill me easily. ‚Ç¨¬£¬£;:",5
It's a very good game I love it but it has problems with memory after a while it takes up a lot of space but other than that it's one of my favorite phone games all they need to do now is add a prestige mode,5
I love the game a lot it has clean graphics and all that but my only downside is that it keeps on kicking me out of battle royal for some reason and I just really hate it so if you are reading this please fix it so I can just play battle royal üôèüôèüôè,4
In some devices cod is lagging and after 1st or 2nd game it lag too much even if you have low graphics on yet your phone support ultra high....... Some changes would be nice.,4
"I downloaded the game with my wifi. Made set up and when I open the game it says "" network error"". Why this error was not at the time of downloading the game? What on earth cause this problem?",1
"After upgrading the game...the auto logging was not working and I tried logging in with my password, but it was not working......I tried forgotten password and no email verification was not sent....this is so bad...pls try fixing this",1
"Good game good graphics...however officially using more then half my phone memory, constant updates that require lengthy downloads which use more space every few days. Im deleting the game until this changes..game shouldnt take 12+ GB not when minecraft is much bigger and only uses 4GB",1
"New guns and more achievements.... like when you throw a grenade far should be one,or if you hit anyone without looking with and tactical should be an achievement",3
"The game itself is excellent,but downloading game maps are a struggle.I can't seem to download maps without the game kicking me out.the game play is excellent.id like to enjoy the new maps if I can get them downloaded",3
Cod mobile is so bad now every game I join there's a dude or a full team of players with legendary or exotic weapons like tf bro this game has basically turned into a pay to win game and the battle pass is not even worth buying the skins you get from the battle pass are not worth it and the weapon skins you get as well. And for the love of God remove exotic weapons or at least nerf them and make them weaker because their just to OP.,1
"I used explosive rounds in Rytec and hit a guy with 4 hit markers and he shots me with arctic .50 and kills me (hacker). I had full armor with kinetic armor. This game used to be fun but nothing is being done about the bs. I know someone who plays this on his TV thru his laptop and ps4 controller, so I know its possible. There's also a glitch, when you use a katana or anything of the sort and run around, you lag across the screen. No point in having armor bc you'll die with one shot in BR match.",1
"Sounds for both the characters and Guns sound absolutely terrible. Graphics are okay, but it's by far the worst CoD games I've ever played would rather Play CoD Ghost. But it has gallons of potential.",3
Perfect in every way possible.......only 1 thing I think is a bit unfair is the fact that controller players are allowed to go up against hand held device players. But other than that. 5 üåü,5
"The guys and I would spend hours on this game we would get online and battleground and multi-player till it was already 2am. Simpler times, now we are off in our stations and being adults. Bring back good memories every moment I log in for a quick round.",4
"Glitch after every update. Ever heard "" If it ain't broke Dont F with it "" lol .So just updated and I have glitches everywhere . 1 I cant accept new friends and yes I know to delete some if I have reached my limit but still nothing . I DELETED over half and still cant get new friends .2 people die and there plus signs are still on the screen saying they need help :/ .",3
Fix the game and it's optimization it runs badly in mp now for low end phones in getting tired about constantly lagging in mp ranked it's frustrating i have no motivation to play this game because of this.even with shaders preload the game is impossible to run smoothly fix the game codm devs this is the reason why players are leaving the game and playing something else,1
"This game, in theory, is awesome. From graphics to gameplay, I love all of it. What keeps me from giving a five star review is the matter of file size and how much it lags.",3
"Since the last update, I cannot log in to my account. I signed up with my google play account and now it's declining my email address. And I've never received a password change email either.",1
Great game keeps crashing every time I get into a group it starts to crash logs me out reboots can't get back in the game have to wait or start a new game but it keeps crashing every time I start a new game or in the middle of a new game,1
This is a good game i wont lie. The only flaw is that everyday it updates itself with over 60mb even after you update to season 3 worth over 2gb. There is just so much regular update for a mobile game. It should be done just once or three times max,1
One of the worste update in cod mobile. I couldn't play your gane guys. It's reconnecting all the time but my internet is good. I don't know what's going on. Please check the problem and fix it.,1
Great game ..but it's a money scam you buy cp points but you do not get anything that is useful like descent weapons or amor .if you want a mystic weapon just will probably have over 12 chances to get it but it will probably take you over ¬£40 to get the item you want even then it's not gaurantied .this company is really taking advantage of it's customer ..love the game hate the extortion prices ...just a rip of üëéif this company does nothing soon I'm sure it will loose loyal players ü§î,2
"I was playing this game since season 1 . I have Snapdragon 870 ,wifi 100mbps still it's taking a decade to open the game . Auto login not working , Network error 4A28 .New update is worst . Do something about it. For now I'm uninstalling this game because can't login using Facebook .",1
"After the new update everything is messed up, I am constantly getting 150 ms even though i have a really good wifi. I have tried everything but still my ping is high. Fix it Please. This game is already dead. But Dont make it unplayble atleast.",1
"Only ranking one star bc there's no 0 star. There is no customer support, and bug fixes never get addressed. Done putting time and money into this game when they won't fix anything",1
What's the problem with this game's server. The game shows configuration download error. Fix that man. Mine network is fine other social media apps are working normally. Please fix that.üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè,1
I woupd enjoy the game more if i could change my graphics settings. I have tried sooooooo many times to change the settings but the only option i am given is low. No other option. Only low,2
"You used to be to back out of the paid stuff when you enter the game by literally tapping the back button on your phone. Now I can't skip any of the paid ads because everytime I back out it asks if I wanna quit the game. It's feels very rapey as in I don't consent to it and can't get away from them no matter what I do. I'm aware the store exist and even bought some stuff. Keep it that way, not with the store's dick down your throat the second you start the game!",5
Good game good graphics good display best battle royal experience but multiple player so difficult because players do alot of toxicity and makes it not fun for us especially beginer like me please if you guys could reduce the toxicity in multiplayer it will be fun again I can imagine playing a game and am sad instead of being happy but anyway you guys got a good game,3
Score given after finishing game are very less. For Killing there is no points at all. So sad. Only money oriented game. Everything need to be payed. Else only basic stuff is available. Some are using cheatcode,1
Shame such a good game is spoilt by the incompetence of the developers smart enough develope such a good game but dumb enough to not understand what random means 5 times nuke town the crossfire then back to nuketown is not random thats forced why not just add a function when selecting random you select all the maps you would like to play in random its not rocket sience,1
It is a nice game with high quality graphics and it is my favorite game. But then also I have given the game four star because currency of call of duty is CP (Cod points) and we have to pay real money for them .Instead of paying real money if we play ranked match and our rank is legendary we should get some CP or if we sign up the game we should get 10000 CP if the CP finished we should pay real money and the game receives too much hacker some of are killing players in the cover also.,4
"The game is amazing with good graphics but I have a problem , I used to play codm and I recently tried to log in , I asked to reset the password and gave my Gmail address , I waited like 3 hours for a mail but didn't get any from codm , please fix the problem and reply as quick as possible",2
i used to love game a lot the graphics where good the game play was great. but not to long ago the game loged me out... wich is not a bad thing it happens offtin not i log in i got a CODm profile i log in and im in a conpletly new profile. ok thats fine i uninstal and re instal. i try to log in and it acts like i dont have a profile. so yeah this happend to me borther to and IDK what to do im out of ideas so F this game.,1
"All time favorite multiplayer game! And now there's tank too! Keep introducing new vehicles and guns! Also, add more levels to the player.. Kinda bored after reaching 150th level",5
I love this game this game in my opinion this is the last good cod game I love playing on my controller ranked is pretty decent so I recommend getting the game and here's a bonus there is no loot boxes! That i am aware of. Also battle royale is good i wish zombies mode was in it still but great game oh yeah my username is thegamerpro93 so if you see me well beware I'm a master rank or higher when you see this so get ur fingers ready to fight bye,5
I am playing this game all things are perfect but the (ms) level can't be stable ...if enemy are coming the ms level will be increased this is the main issue kindly set this issue .,1
"Now with the new updates, it's almost a perfect game, but a lot of people really miss the ""classic"" zombies mode. It was tons of fun, and I don't understand why it was removed in the first place.",4
One of the best battle Royale game. But now the game is getting pay to play just like free fire. It is difficult for us non purchaser to win without any gun skins. If this continues then I guess soon the game will be boycotted.,2
"The ps4 controller's right stick and bottons wont work at all, im pretty bad with the phone controls as my phones screens is messed. Loved it but now i cant even play",3
Awesome it is great for call of duty fans I love it I also Wish you guys can add more maps for the practice AI but there is a problem because the game lags when I play my enemies are frozen but I can still move please fix this,4
My game has not been logging in for days .it doesn't auto login in and it has been showing loading timeout wen i try logging in with Facebook or codm account . Have the game up to 3 tikes previously because if this situation pls help resolve this issue,2
"No bugs are removed from the app, but only update is given everytime with poor quality gaming. I had to uninstall other apps in my mobile every time to update it but all the efforts in vain due to glitches in the game.",1
"In the last 2 months over 60 thousand gamers have abandoned CODM because, other than graphics, CODM SUKS. It STILL lags, crashes kicks and has hundreds of hackers. Most gamers are playing, or waiting for, the global version of APEX LEGENDS & RAINBOW 6 (R6) to be released in late May 2022. For now download Modern Combat.",1
"Constantly throwing in little 75mb updates twice a day, the process takes sooo long I'm beginning to remember why we deleted this game. BR matchmaking always pairs me up with ghosts for teammates so I end up getting wrecked 2 minutes in. Only good thing is the MP gamemode",2
"Bruh I can't even install this game reason I don't know,I have plenty of storage empty still can't install it just cancel the whole dame thing.Else I tried to get this game from friend it simpley denies to install and says app doesn't install. One time it installed but suddenly after I give permission to access storage it just says playstore support what to do please help me ASAP!!!!!!",1
"As I said earlier it is a good game, but I asked not to make someone join or oneself to join another game (that has already been started) when playing a fresh multiplayer mode where you're already on a losing side.",4
Complaining on any of the platforms you give is just an insult to us playing the game. You just do not respond. The lag in South Africa is so bad the game is not enjoyable anymore. It works fine until you get someone in front of you. The one moment you are shooting the next the other player is running 10m away already this is not any fun any more. People spent money on the game but they do not even want to spent money to get better ping for other part of the world.,1
"Great game my dudes absolutely love it. This one is for activision. Change the lame a** song for snoops emote, it is totally dumb and out of place. Whoever picked it is evil ü§£ like come on dude you know it does not fit the character.",4
"Every 10min or so it lags. The game is filled with people playing on their computers. This is not fun anymore, just frustrating! What a disappointed.",1
"Do the developers are ruining the game and experience. Everyday you go on the game you have to wait atleast 5mins or more for downloads. I have been playing this from the start and this is the worst graphics I have seen and the lag, oh the lag. Oh wait sorry im dead now.",3
I Completely love the game everything is just perfect. But I installed it on a new device yesterday and have been playing it. But now everytime I try to launch it it just assumes that command and returns to home screen what could be the issue?,4
I expected better from activision. The last classic update is buggy and clearly untested. doors turn into walls. server rarely connects. Test your updates before releasing them to production. Its shameful. to create something good and break it . do not download this game. not this season,1
Controller support out of the box. I'm able to team with my friend at any level. The graphics are amazing. If you like fps this is the one,5
The game is the best out there . No problems with ads every second. If there is a issue its fixed before you even have time to report it,5
This is by far the best mobile game out love it I play way more then I should but can't help it the only things I could say might need changed is lower the price of the legendary and mythical for people who have bought a certain amount of guns I by have five and am at almost 600$ spent and maybe open up the mythic guns to be sold more regularly thanks and epic game,5
Love it love it just the best game ever can not stop playing it aiii straight up it's very challenging at most times but will get the hang of it straight up get beaten alot of times but who cares just keep on grinding lol 6stars,5
One of the best mobile game... i realy love this game...but i have 1 request.possible you can make a full game replay where we can watch and review the last game we've played..for a newbie like me..its hustle to make screen record while you are playing . Thank you,5
Loved it better than pubg Activision did it as always And I think instead of Hard point they should add a Hostage situation in game If possible it would be great And Also after Every season update we have to download every map and every thing to download again which kind of hurts Activion needs to fix this problem And From a few weeks i am facing another problem which furing Br match my game lags alot which is just during br match In lobby or Multiplayer matches games works just fine,5
First you put me into the match where all the players are bots (and please don't deny it !!!) and then when I want to get out of the match you penalise me coz it's a ranked match. WOW !!! Bravo,1
App always downloads stuff over wifi even when auto-download is unticked. Ask for download is ticked but the app ignores and downloads anyways. Which is bad for people who are connected via an access point.,4
i like it but every time it updates it kicks me off every time i try to reload the game it still does ill uninstall and download again and still kicks me off even on wifi it gets more occurent when im on wifi fix this please,4
Log in problem.always show time out whereas internet connection is good. It was good upto season 2 but now it's worst. I suggest not to download the season 3 it has lot of log in problem even in 4G+ network.,3
"It's honestly one of my favorite versions of COD it has all the maps, all the guns and it looks and runs great on my phone. I recommend to anyone who likes fps or cod in general.",5
The problems are I get shot once and die. It takes me 5 or 6 bullets to kill someone. Also if you lose you get points taken away. It's a huge problem when you can't kill people cuz they kill you with one shot,2
Every time game open login problem and my progress levels is gone return 4 level 5 level every time i reach level 7 ... but not stay my game progress.. Very disappointed,3
"I take my 4 stars back, my CODM has been on TIME OUT since I updated it, even when I uninstalled and installed the second Time. This app is expensive in my country, better do something quick. PNG üáµüá¨",1
"Optimize the game more please, since the latest update for new season I have been getting more stutters as of late. The new changes visually are making it a bit slow, do better optimizing before releasing an update to the public",4
Call of duty used to be one of my best games like everyday I would wake up and play it but the only reason I gave it a one is because I can't retrieve my account like I can't login to it like since the new season started (somewhere in January)I've been trying to login I don't wanna create a new account cause the one I had has everything my skins guns level and I was a legendary player but please cod can u bring back the guest log in and warn us that u are taking it out please may u see this text,1
I can't play it anymore because of this one connection problem* whenever i try to play the game of just tells me to check connection and try again. I tried many ways to fix it but none of them worked even after resetting the game files please fox it cause it's my fav game,2
"One waste ah time for people who live in Trinidad and Tobago after spending money an time playing this game an seeing the lag an nonessential things we spending our credit card on an to what we have gotten in the pass or an let's not talk about the lag,clearly France not sure what there doing,but to be quite honest I will not even rate this game half a star",1
"I request all the team please optimized the game so that we can play smoothly. Too much frame drop, rendering, lag even network and device is good enough.",2
I am not able to see my kills after the match overs it only shows our points. Id like to know how to set default to see my kills rather than my score in deathmatches. This changed after the latest update,1
As of right now I'm redownloading the game because I encountered an weird bug that makes my game have a half second delay on my aim and buttons also my game just wouldn't register some of my presses on the jump button and crouch button.,2
I am having a wonderful time I'm in the rank of top 10 I'm doing good I just don't understand why is it that my screen and the game goes black and takes me all the way out and it counts for a quit game and it makes my record look bad so can you tell me what I need to do anybody,5
So I recently got nerve damage in my fingers so it's hard to play just on this phone screen is it against the rules to use a controller adapter please contact me I would like to know it doesn't say anything in the guidelines that it's against the rules I just wanted to make sure,3
The game is amazing but don't waste your money on buying crates with soldiers. They're always last In the draw resulting in more money being spent. Cheap shot,3
Really great game some of the best graphics and audio I have heard in a while..very realistic if I could I would give it 10stars no doubt..,5
"Since past week, game is lagging a lot. I reduced graphics quality to medium, even then, the game lags. It's irritating to play.",3
WORST GAME EVER. It was my first time of playing COD. Then it finally came to the login screen then I signed in using my account and it played the tutorial then I went into the first match. My team had won and i got the MVP. Then after the match was over it took me to the login screen and said i was banned. i have no idea why I got banned. Then i logged in using another account and it immediatly said i got banned without even playing the tutorial. I saved money for wifi 5gb data all gone wasted,1
Worst gaming app ever. The amount of downloads this app makes is second to nothing!! Everyday when I'm logging in there is more than 100 mb download that take forever!! And after logging into the game there is another extra 300 mb to download!,1
"The game lags an awful lot,especially when there's enemies nearby. Average ping in SA is 90-130ms,no matter how fast my reflexes are I'll always get knocked like I was standing still. We desperately need a SA server or at least an African Server for CoDM.",2
The game is great i enjoy playing it but i need resolution changing option under graphics settings coz my phone's default resolution setting is very high and it lags i hope we get it on next update,4
"Amazing, probably the best first person shooter on the mobile. Brilliant graphics and amazing seasons to keep you going.",5
After the new season update anytime I wanna play it always shows me time out which didn't happen before now it shows sometimes when I want to play and I have to wait for like hours before it starts working...... Now I can't even play any more,1
"Need to reduced the game size for me it is 10 GB right now and remove the old maps and unwanted things, we don't want new maps every season and for low end devices please optimize the game",2
"Fantastic Gaming so far, I connected my Facebook and I'm hoping I'll be able to login again if I change Device. Thanks. The Best Mobile Game. Tho I don't like the fact that I have to download Camo and weapons.",4
"I had lots of issues playing this game previously, but they have optimized a lot and gameplay really improved. The only this now is they are increasing the game size everyday. So you need a good device to play.",4
A great game i played for a few years i think but the zombies mode please just bring back the old zombies mode it was so much more fun than this one the map and everything else was so much better,5
"Recently I've been experiencing wifi connection problems. Game doesn't open with working wifi connection but it works with mobile data(Sim)..i have checked it many times,even reinstalled it few times,still not working..Please verify and solve it.",2
"After the last game udate(season 4) the game is a big pile of trash, the game doesnt show my skins anymore, the audio cuts out of nowhere, the new tournament icon doesnt show on my main screen, my ping spikes to 200ms even my internet connection being flawless... dude seriously...",1
The update came a long time ago. The pin case has not been made yet. This is the weakest game full of bugs. Time was running out. Spent money on the game. Please fix the bugs ....,1
"I have full network bar , played a game well and when I closed it to restart 10mins after it's showing ""time out"" consecutively....it's frustrating because I dnt even know what is wrong",3
"It was a great game so many updates when I first played it it was only characters,guns,matches and skins for guns but the game got harder the longer I played so I stopped playing for 2 months now its easy",5
"Thanks for separating HD Resources. But frequent updates are irritating. I play only battle Royale, don't force me to download contents for multiplayer in the game startup. Please consider this feedback.",3
I've played this game for over a year and it was great. Then all of a sudden yesterday it quit working and kicked me out of my profile and all my saved game stuff. Kept asking me to make a new profile and start over. I think I'll just be done with it.,1
"The game is good... Okay let me stop lying to myself, codm is only hyped around being a mobile first person shooter from a good franchise, activision only makes the game worse by adding in cosmetics that take up over 70% of the game, this makes the game laggy and unplayable just as alot of people have been saying but noone at activision has a big enough brain to actually optimize anything so every device is now almost unplayable except for an ipad that costs over $1200 just listen",1
"In the game, you have to pay money to win. A large number of hackers. The server is unknown and the ping is high. Throughout the game, you must play with iPhones and iPads with high fps. I am not satisfied with this game at all.",1
"The tank battle royale Is probably my favorite game mode, well done. What about a mod to the battle royale centered around ancient combat? A whole game could be constructed on a similar engine which incorporates siege battle and warfare with ancient weapons.",5
Best battle royal game i ever played. graphics are amazing . Only problem is game is too much bigger in size.. and updates are bigger in size too . Take too much space in my phone.,3
"COD used to fun to play. Now with all the updates, people camping and hacking, not sure if I wanna continue playing. Regular MP matches are harder to win vs ranked MP. Such a shame. Gone are the good days of COD... :(",2
After an update CoD had stopped recognizing any of avaliable controllers. Last tested is razer product. No controllers are working and no troubleshooting methods that developers suggest are working.,1
I enjoy playing it becoz simply put it is a real entertaining game that satisfies a persons mood I literally have a earge to play this game it really has me deep into the combat levels of the game an the graphic I must say is so realistic which makes this game in particularly a great game to play!!! So enjoy it,5
Hi really cool the game is very competitive and the new Mac 10 but there's something there's happening a bug in br flying textures and all kind off stuff Activision if you read this fix the bugs pls,5
"It is reality that the gameplay and graphics of game is too good & activision introduces the new chracters and maps regularly with time so that the players cannot bored with game.But the serious problem that need attention is the game size,lagging and ping issues which increases day by day.Due to which low or normal device players face thses problems and they delete the game against their will.So please focused on these issues please.Thanks!",1
"Is there no way of combining ADS with hip fire? I want my assault rifles to be full ADS meaning aim to fire, but the snipers should be fully hip fire, meaning I can fully control the aim and shot. That's it. Please",3
This Game is not good every time i log in is alwalys updating all the maps and resources and also guns its a wasted of time... I already Update before and now if i am going to play it will update and even if i finish to update all... So now i stop playing this game... I will not recommed to my friend and friends and to my onthers friends and to my neighbor my relatives and to all my friend in basketbal and to my work mate.... Kalas,1
because of the new update codm started glitching the server are always late audio problems and the textures are not loading its unplayable. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME DON'T DOWNLOAD IT.,1
Awsome game. An offline mode would be nice and the graphic setting must plz be able to be put lower lots of people want to play this amazing game but with lag they cant.,5
I did give this game five stars at first and it is very fun indeed graphics are great and game play is Smooth to me but since the new update the games crashes and shutdown and sends you to your home scream I tried everything ik to try and same thing please fix this bug and also I play on a Moto G stylus 5g 2021 -2022,3
I can't even sign into my account everytime I try to sign in it just tells me it's invalid and when I click forgot password it doesn't even send me a email telling me and so now I can't even enjoy the game. Someone pls fix this.,1
I love the game but it takes long time to level up but there is a big with the game ever time I use a controller i can't move aim or look around I don't know what's wrong but please help me if this is not the game itself,4
Beautiful peice of art keep it up needs some tweaking here and there specially the size of the game gets crazy for old players but other than that it's simply fabulous,4
"Why does it say 2gb, then have you download files that is up to 5 or more gb's, other wise its a good game, easy to level up, and have og maps and guns. Please fix the heavy file.",4
Great game but the lucky draws are too expensive. The crates you get duplicates and bundles is the same thing. When you spend real cash we should at least get all prizes. May you be unfair forever.,4
Ever since I did the new update it just like literally kicks me out of the whole app in the middle of a game and then I have to reopen it and redownload and join it again I don't do that several times and now since the update it's not letting me download anything what's the point anymore,1
"Every time I download the game on my pc with an emulator I get banned after the first match. Its so stupid, and I know its not the emulator because the youtuber Dysmo uses an emulator to play sometimes. I created 3 different accounts and the same thing happens.",1
"This game is absolutely amazing! Played it since 2020 but my first account is deleted accidentally but its not a problem overall,by the way the game has reduced the lags.Ill give this game a 10/10.Keep up on the good work devsüëç",5
Unable to register for week 2 of the championship thing. It opens then says error to open in the app. Which I did then let's me click everything except register,1
Was a good game. But now there is only lag lag and lag. Glitches. This game is dying slowly. No matter what u do there is always lag. There are always giltches. Game play stops and when it resumes u are already dead. This new update is just lagging.. Deleting it,1
Great game best FPS ive played on mobile. When you play multiplayer you get alot of bots though you really notice the difference when you play ranked where there is no bots lol. Battle royale mode is fun to but i dont play it much.,5
The game has been lagging like crazy and not just every so often every game I play it lags and glitchs so bad that I'm dead before I even knew what happened. Game isn't enjoyable anymore.,2
"Great, great game. I'd just like to get at least one or two good teammates half the time... I keep getting bots on my team when we're playing against an army of try hards",5
I love this game but I'm extremely disappointed I paid money for CP points and didn't get them then I waited for two hours nothing so I tried to buy again finally got them but money from the first one was taken out still yet no points I'm extremely angry.,3
"I love this game, but I don't understand why they have to make the zombies so bad.. only 5 rounds? A static play area? No wall guns? No fun. Multi-player and BR are badass though",5
For some reason for the past few weeks I haven't been able to log in. Keeps saying timeout I thought it was my wifi and had the company upgrade it to the maximum strength and still no,3
"Spent hundreds only to not get a single legendary or mythic weapon from any drop. This game is just a money dump so Activision can make thousands off of players since they apparently don't already make enough from their console and PC games. Only reason I still play is because my friends do, and my computer broke so I can't play their ""AAA"" titles.",1
Absolutely best game i have ever played üíô However the developers should turn back on captcha to get rid of bots. Then turn up security on misuse of code like using trickster in multi-player or infinite operator skill. Also clan war should have 30 nodes a week 5 every twenty-four hours it would increase participation in clan war and therefore make it more fun to play. DID LOVE THE GAME NOW THERES NOTHING BUT BOTS SPENT HUNDREDS ON THE GAME AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING!!!!,1
"So it's been 2 years since my first review lol love the game. I just wish we could use all the maps in practice mode, to learn the map before jumping in a live match",4
Getting version info shows only. I have 4G mobile internet service also WiFi is very fast but I couldn't open it. Getting version info again and again but didn't started the game... What should I do....,4
"My favourite game. But bots in multiplayer, seriously! ln battleroyal its ok. But not in multiplayer. Next thing I want to say is if u make a career mode (offline) then it will become more popular",5
"The latest update is worst..Always being reconnected even after good internet speed, this issue has emerged with latest version , I have experinced this in search and destroy with my redmi note 4 mobile, please take immediate action, otherwise I will be looking for other alternatives.",1
so addicting! I just don't get why you went for a different route for zombies when back in 2009 there was a perfect version of what we get in console,4
Tired of getting network error and also time out. I have the fastest internet connection and still getting this error. Trash totally trash.,1
I have played since season 1 its a great game I created my own clan and take part in clan wars I play it with my siblings and cousins as well as a few friends there is always something new and it really combines all of the games together very well overall awesome game,4
"Worked fine first day, but next day it becomes unstable with connection problems. I hardly play anymore since for some reason i lost connection frequently. That's was fun but time to say good bye.",3
There is new problem with the new update..!! I have full network.. Still showing network problem... The game gets stucked in b/w the match.. Always network issue showing.... Though I have full network with full Internet speed,3
I keep trying to download maps to play but soon as I do it crashes and force closes the app. Tried on 2 separate devices..... Anyone else have this issue?,2
Okay so every time the maker of this game updates it he adds more graphics to where you cannot play the mother f***** because there's so much traffic it takes up all the room on your phone and it won't allow you to download it and it's really slow and it glitches out whoever the maker of this is you're b*******,1
It's been 2 years I've been playing codm. Gameplay is always getting better. Bt in recent I'm facing a problem with bag pack skin. Please fix that bug,5
The game whole time freezes and reverses everytime me and my team play a game it freezes or reverses the whole time I gave it great review and this is how it turned out I hope in the next update it will work better next time thank u,1
"I cannot retrieve my original account, no emails were sent to make a new password. Made a new account, and tried to log in, and it won't let me. If you're not going to let us log in, make a warning for it.",1
Good game but it needs to be able to support controllers for phones. Why use a Xbox controller for your phone. Razor kishi is supposed to be the best phone game controller and you can't use it with this game,2
"Great game, however way too many micro-transactions, thanks for improving Zombies Mode, please keep it fresh and keep adding to it!",4
"Getting a ""mythic gun skin"" in this game cost like 165+ dollars (assuming it's the last thing you get from the loot box *which is will be*). If you're okay with that this game is pretty alright lol",4
After the new update the game keeps freezing and lagging. It's messing up my performance. Needs to be fixed!,2
"Besides COD Online, this is the best COD ever made. Well its basically is cod online but not Chinese. However the zombie mode is completely wack, idk what you guys were thinking, its not fun at all and very boring. üëé",5
I had to redownload it multiple times n still get the same text as download reconfiguration failed etc.. it never starts and yeah its updated.,1
Game in all is great but when trying to login using my Activision account it goes to load the page then closes and reloads the game like nothing happened I lost my account and can't find anything about it,2
I would rate is as 4/5 it is best playing in mobile and tab espiciallly the bug and glitches and when I join a lobby some times the joystick doesn't work even though by landing pls fix this glitch.Down load it popular gameüëÜ,4
"Seriously a lot of cheaters lately. I got shot by someone through several walls and fmj rounds can't do that much. It's not hard to tell when someone is using auto aim or not... You guys need to crack down on cheaters and hackers, I'm about to uninstall",1
"Only ranked matches our multiplayer their graphics are fine but graphics of battle royal has become very poor. There's no fun in playing battle royal to me, Pleasei request that old seasons graphics in battle royal should be applied",3
The game is fun but its a pay to win game the more you pay the more you win it also likes to cheat you in many ways so i give it a 1 because its not fair to its playerspaying or not if you cheat a nonpaying person your really cheating the person that is paying so even though its fun its just knowing that you dont have the control over the win,1
After the season 3 update the mp mode becones mute whenever i try to okay it and its not enjoyable okaying a match without sound but the sound comes back immediately after the match pkease fix this bug fast,2
"I spend time after time every day all day grinding for daily crates just to get the Park-Spirit skin, I even had been playing when I should've been studying for school and all I kept getting was duplicates from axe camo and flashbang camo day after after day the same two things camos + camos +camos duplicates duplicates duplicates. Love the game but all that grind for the character and all I get is duplicates for the same item's over and over and most good stuff isn't grindable not fun like tha",1
Trust me this game deserves to be one of the best online mobile games ever it's way to addictive plus I can play with my friends. My only problem is cod points because I really need those but I can't get them.,5
Gameplay is cool but the lag is outrageous. Brand new phone with great connection and games lag is ridiculous. I have fun for 15 mins then quit. Anybody with old phone I'd recommend not even playing.,3
Ive been playing this game for a while and come to conclusion that this game has tremendously improved and for that i love it and recomend anyone if you want to play any multiplayer shooter game this is the best game to get. Thanks.,5
"Is there any was the developers can add support for other controllers? For example I have the Razer Kishi controller, but CODM doesnt recognizes the controller. I enjoy playing this game. Great job!",5
The game has really good graphics but why can't I see other people's skin they look default. But anyways I still like the game alot and can't wait for more cool updates.,5
So i played one match while using the blueStacks App. Account was banned ???? BlueStacks lets people play google play / apple play games on PC. Not sure why but i was glad i didn't spend money with this game. was looking for a FPS for my PC since i can't upgrade. oh well...... Give my money to someone else. lol,1
Hands down the best shooter on mobile. They always add just enough new content to keep the game interesting. But for the love of all things COD PLEASE BRING BACK PROP HUNT.....,4
Worst update I have ever seen in my life in video games new season is pathetic visibility is 0 armours are worst health level go down in two bullets even if you have 150 % health ! playing skills doesn't matter if you have money to purchase weapons so you are undefeatable other wise you don't have any chance to win that's soo unfair I am deleting this game and I will never installed it again and not recommending to my friends I will like to install battel ground India,1
Has become unstable since the latest update. Gets stuck at 99% initialization and won't load. What's going on?,3
Been playing this game ever sense it was released. The game is absolutely amazing and so much fun and also I love the fact that you can play on your mobile device with a PS4 Controller,4
I just downloaded it thaught it be cool to play with a friend but nope it won't let in it says I have unstable net work even tho it's perfectly and I need to clear storage so that's what I did but I still can't play and it's making me really mad to the point where it's not even funny,1
"Season 3, 2022 is buggy on my device (Poco X3 Pro on android 12). Touch doesn't respond sometimes and there is the occasional lag although I get 60 fps.",3
"Everything is great, I just wish you guys could bring the old zombies back. From black ops 2. that would be amazing.",4
I love playing but as of this morning I seem to have lost all my data? And I can't log in. It keeps making me create a new character and I would rather keep using the one I spent $$ on. Any ideas? I have linked my FB to the original account but it won't let me in. Getting frustrated.,5
Best game I have played But I would like to suggest to the developer to remove the red screen effect when health is low in battle royale It make players confuse and stop shooting at enemies Nothing less you deserve 5 stars,4
I like the game but I waste my time shooting ppl and them kill me with only two shots I'm shooting all my bullets on them keep having to reload. I never ragged on a game like this one.,2
Why when I use via Controller üéÆ I Get Put With All Bots! Bots Too Eazy But What's The Point In enabling Controller if you can't play with your friends...Stuck in Matchmaking 300+ countdowns! Crazy! TAKE THE WHOLE CONTROLLER ASPECT OUT THE GAME IF IT DOESN'T WORK! Thanks üëçüèæ Great Job,5
Hate it that the in app updates come daily or after two days... I mostly just want to play the game the update downloads kill my vibe. I at time just end up playing another game just cause of the update and the time it takes to load,1
"The game is perfect but I don't know why every time a person joins the game it starts to lag like 35mc to 60 or more every single time somebody joins the game, if u know how to fix it a least tell me how.",4
"The size of game is unnecessary very big as compared to other games that's the reason why most of the gamers do not prefer this game . The rate of lagging during game is too much high specially during battle royale due to large size of game , codm please remove the unnecessary things from codm to make smooth to play",2
"Please bring back classic zombies! I loved it! Everything else about this game is decent but isn't enough to keep my attention, but classic zombies did! The new zombies mode sucks. Please bring back classic zombies",2
Multiple purchases went through when not authorised. Google play passed the book to the developer. Developer fails to respond. Transactions don't show on your account until after the two hour refund window.,1
"The game seems great and is a lot of fun, but it won't let me finish the in game downloads. As soon as I start the download the app crashes.",2
Just a masterpiece game. I am played many days long. But now it is fully bugged for it's ping problem. Please don't play with our emotions. We need stable network.,3
"Everytime I open COD, What I see is network error pls restart the game. Even my wifi has one of the fastest internet speed.ü§£ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2
It shows authorization error everytime I try to login through Facebook. Please fix this issue. Used to be my favourite but now it's just disappointing.,1
Its very fun i played in this game allready 3 years. But the new update is super bad! Its just wired. I dont like it. The way everything look its bad. I hate it. I might delete it. Istg its bad af. I hate it now. Anyway i think the old version was better.,4
"these days i am thinking i might be switch on apex legend atleast they currently working on their game not like you, not working on bugs and adding more and more bugs your currently focusing attracting more new player but i think you're losing more than gaining and codm is no longer that game that i used to play when i am bored now it only giving me frustration and depression, hope someone read this and work on this",1
"It's a great game. Online and thrill-motivated He's got pure skins, but you can buy with CP. If you care about Playra a lot, it'll be much better.",4
"New update's not that good. You get a ""rating"" instead of showing number of kills in MP matches. Plus they took all my credits. I had like 36k, all gone. Not sure what that's about",4
New patch really destroyed the game very bad mechanics. I was legendary before the patch but with new season trash of update it's so noob friendly and assists campers to victory really sad for this but I am leaving this game for good trash company updates.,1
This game oftenly crashes and this is happening with me and gives the penalty of 2-3 hours for just crashing the game Doesn't even gives you a chance to reconnect Such a bad game,1
After latest update i am not able to play. My internet connection is superb but i get disconnected again n again. I can play all other online games flawlessly. Kindly notice and fix the problem,2
"No free stuff except cb coins or skins, don't need skins need more kit. And it's forcing me to sync account when I'm not on social media, keeps booting me out the game. Lost maxed lvl account that took ages to build as I'm not a ptp gamer om this game.",2
I loved this game a lot .....when it doesn't lag but there is lag but now it's intolerable. I know it's a big game...but still do something to reduce lag... maybe... resolution..idk...but love the game..,3
"it takes a ton of memory, 15 gigs already, but over all a great game, as far as graffic an game modes hope they can get memory fixed size fixed, if not all good!",3
I have been playing this game long time. My favourite game ever. But now when i enter and login then show me ( time out) Problem. But connection is so good no problem. I Can't play the game so please fix this problem.,2
Love this game cod always have been my favorite the new br map love the graphics and the new characters as well this is the best game ever keep up the good work UPDATE‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èTHE GAME IS STARTING TO BE BETTER SINCE THE RECENT UPDATE STILL HAVE MINOR LAGGS AND GLITCHES TO FIX BUT I CAN NOW PLAY AGAIN UNTIL THE OTHER LAGGING AND GLITCHES ARE FIXED THANKS SO MUCH DEVELOPER....OH ALSO CAN YOU GUYS ADD ON A COUPLE OF CAMPAIGN STORY MODES ON THERE THAT WOULD BE DOPE TO TRY OUT ‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
The best on mobile I've played üî•üî•ü§ûüèª but I have problems with my ping and that's the only problem I have. The wifi is perfectly fine and there's no problem with it so its only that all SA players are experiencing,4
The game play is excellent. And good deals. The stuff you can get with credits should be cheaper. That's my only issue.,5
"I dont like how much time it takes to open the app. Also almost everytime i open the game, it downloads which eats away memory Overall the game is good",4
This game is awesome graphics are just awesome but I have a problem first I face a loding timeout problem and auto disconnect from the server please fix the issu and reduce the game size,4
"Best call of duty ever made in my opinion, here I have a few issues now. First of all, the overpowered, broken, annoying classes are ruining BR. The Halo jump jetpack should of never been added to the game period. Second, stop adding broken smg's to the game like the fennec and Mac 10. Everyone uses them and makes the game no fun when everyone is using the same guns, classes, and tactics",5
I changed my mind this game is terrible after awhile it won't let you access your account trust me I should know I literally can log in with my Activision id and pass on the website but on cod mobile it says it doesn't exist when clearly it does this game is also full of modders fun fact and loot crates that'll take hundreds of dollars to get the one item you want just waste your time with a different game this one isn't it chief.,1
The game is good I mean like everything looks so good The Guns of ever see the the characters and yeah I just want one favor from Call of Duty and I want you to add the Ragdoll effect because my friend has it and I don't,5
This is awesome it's just the graphics and the speed is horrible an also I would make it 5 stars but the speed an graphics that is it please do what you can to make the game better but also the game is awesome.,4
Very bad performance always updating updating or not open the game. Don't waste mobile memory. Per day is updating and the open the game is error error you have error. wastage MB only. Always best free fire give free fire 5 star Call of Duty 0.1 - Star,1
"I updated already and everything is now perfect no more lags or freezing during play, thanks for listening and working on the reviews, keep up the good work guys.",5
Best game out right now hands down. Except I was at level 150 n I went n got a new phone n I dow loaded the game again n my account was gone some how. I kept trying to get In touch with Activision but that's impossible. I had so many hours n money invested n now it's gone....,5
"There needs to be a theater mode because I'm out here being blamed for someone else's incompetence. Also, People shouldn't be able to join once that game has started & ruin the game with their camping.",1
The game is good and all but I'm having a problem with connecting my Google account? I remember connecting it a while ago before getting a new phone but now when I try to sign in it's just filled with errors.,3
The new update has some problem... It is always showing network error even though the network is very good... I am very much disappointed.. Please look into this issue and resolve ASAP,2
Still lots to work on like lagg issues. Getting killed after getting behind cover but congrats for the achievement. Will change review once updated.,3
Not much smooth because of the people falling through walls but a very good game and the only thing if you want to have them not fall through walls is ragdoll mode and very good game I don't know why people on here are toxic tho so I rate it 5 stars out of 5,5
They allow cheating. It's really bad on here. It's so bad the game becomes unplayable for long stretches. They have a reporting system but I don't think it actually does anything. I think they have it to seem like they care about cheating. I play multiple games against the same people who cheat every time. I report they and they still are allowed to play.,1
EDIT* I started playing on my iPhone and I spent money and was really proud of my stats and all that but now I have an android phone and I cannot access my account that was created on my iPhone so I'm having to start all the way over from the beginning its kind of a bummer.,3
Codm has fixed a lot of bugs and lag but u still face frame drops. Fix the minute frame drops and this game will be much more better..,4
Games good but the space needed aint gonna be good for Android users also updates do lags my br alot please think through on resource compression and update resource check ingame thank youÔºÅ Mobile FPS this games overall at the #1ÔºÅ Cuz knives out/pubg and blah blahs cant even come close to this games qualityÔºÅ,4
Now a days we are all hating cod because of hanging issues and move on to another games in the list...we need smooth playing experience... We don't need any graphics material...,2
Mobile and ipad players shouldn't be playing against each other in ranked. This is not fair . And please atleast add latency lock for ranked just like csgo. I have been playing since global beta. And I don't want to delete this game .,1
"The game is nearly perfect but after I updated to season 3, my rank was automatically reduced. What's wrong?. If you can find solution to this, I'd be really happy.",3
"Look, I love this game. But the only thing I hate is there is so much lag. When I get close to an Enemy It starts to get choppy. Look I am sorry but I have to give this game a 1. And please add a jungle environment.",1
Since the last update the game is lagging like hell though I've good and stable internet. Please give one more good update to resolve this issue. 2 stars are more than enough after this update but COD is love so not being so harsh on it.,2
"I really love it I've been playing for a long time. But the game needs more good free stuff and, to hard to get camos for my gun. But in all 5 star game. I love it.",5
"My only problem is it's game size(after downloading all assets). It takes 11 - 12 GB(or more) space, I have only a 32 gb storage and 74% is full after downloading it and more after downloading the assets! Please, I really request you developers, lower its sizeüôèüèªüôèüèªüò¢",3
"For 3 days now, am unable to login using my facebook account. I can't tell whats the problem and it is really annonying since i have played the game for 2 years without any problem.",4
"This game is beautiful and all and playing it is breath taking but I only have one problem, I once was given the opportunity to buy cod points with airtime (load) but now when I try to buy cod points I don't see the option in buying cod points with airtime?",4
This game is starting to suck really bad I'm about to delete it every time you turn around you have to download maps weapons and every time there's an update I'm sick of this!!!!!!!!!!ü§¨,1
The game is way too overloaded even for high end devices. Please adjust the load on devices. Unload what can be unloaded from the resources to make the game slightly light.,3
Probably the shittest season... People on low end device cannot play BR because of lag caused due to the sandstorm... And after every match... It shows Loading timeout even though i have a good network connection... You guys are gonna lose a lot of gamers this season,1
I don't know what the hell is happening with this before this update my fps never dropped but after this update my fps drops in middle of the match and then suddenly get back to normal after in 30 seconds or 1min but it sucks now plzzz fix this fps problem.,1
Why not have free characters for USA? Is the United States less valuable than China and Taiwan in Calaf Duty? Please create a new section for the USA region. Why has the volume of the game decreased in this season? If problems are solved ÿå Thanks,4
improve the stability as well and every time this game gets the update and then internal again it says to download the data and when i download all it goes to around 10gb. there is no ultra fps option realme X7 Max?,4
It deserves a 2/5 because its a great game..but the lag is what I hate the most.u could have the best network but still lag out.If you could please bring a server to South Africa that would be highly appreciated.,2
It was alright before but after the update it says download configuration failed please connect to a network while it is connected to wifi and just closes afterwards. Pls fix this,1
This new update is quite a problem! Auto downloads automatically resume even if I pause them. This is ridiculous!,3
Good game. Game designers have sorted the bugs that I pointed out though I am still seeing cheaters throughout gameplay but other than this I think game designers should give the chance for prize draws such as the one of Snoop Dogg or Jigsaw we can only get draws like this if people pay but those who don't pay in cash for prize draws only their time and efforts we people who free to play also should be deserved the chance to obtain the rewards from prize draws from grinding in matches.,4
"Been playing Since march 2021, Alot of fun, addictive and stressfulat times...I changed my review cause I'd the developers to make the game less stressful for low end devices with 2gb ram",2
The game puposly sets up challenges and make it hard to complete the challenge for exzample if a challenge is to slide 10 times in a match ill get killed before the 4th slide or if i have to revive a team mate the lobby is so sweaty the second i crouch to revive them i get killed even when no one is around somehow ill get snipped from half way across the map this game is becoming silly i cant wait for Apex to come out or i might just go back to fortnite even tho i feel fortnite is just as silly,1
"After updating my OnePlus 8T to Oxygen OS 12, the game is capped at 60 FPS for MP, before this it used to run at 90FPS. Looks like CODM has dropped 90 FPS support for OnePlus... I'll stop playing this until 90 FPS is back for my device.",1
When will the Max frame rate settings will be available for Realme 8 5g smartphone? I am using this phone and its processor is capable of playing Codm in max settings I know because phones like Realme X2 with snapdragon 730g processor which is a older processor can play it in max settings.,3
Facing Authorization error never seen before not able to open the game. Does any one have any idea of this?. I tried downloading the app multiple times but still facing same.,2
One of the biased games I ever play... Same gun with same equipment one take 7 shots to kill and one with purchases take 3 shots to kill ... What kind of this game it is??? Speechless... Too much biasedness...,1
"Is a good game to play if you are a cod fan or just for looking fa fun game to play I'm just hoping that there could be Mobile cod campaign with a campaign and multiplayer achievement system updated sistom in the future, but it's amazing game.",5
Since the update I haven't been able to access the game. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times but the same results ‚òπÔ∏è,1
"I actually give 5‚≠ê for game, but skin[camos] notification are too much annoying and free skin everyday make this game look even cheaper then 'pubg', as a gamer if player reaches this much level to get skin will be better also useless updates cast more data and comes with more bugs developers need to fix these issues so 3‚≠ê for overall",3
FF max seems kiddish..bgmi feels too small now ..pubg new State is fine but nothing matchs Codm.. seriously ‚ù§Ô∏è..this is the best FPS available on Android now..but you should've a high end device for this bcoz this is the biggest out of all battle royale gamesüòå..and when you play it on max fps .. that's so freakin' smooth,5
This game is really annoying alot of errors and glitches and unfair in challenges and why do we have to register every week in the world champions and if I didn't register every week nothing counts to me this is a really silly requirement and really silly game üòëüòëüòë,1
"Great game, but the only thing that keeps it from a perfect score is the amount of storage it takes up. I have 19 gigs free on my phone after installation im down to 13 gigs",4
i really love this game but this does take up alot of space and gb i use i hate seeing new updates and more updatse its just annoying but it will be great if the game will just stop doin a update maybe you guys could just do a update evry year whitch i think will be more easy but still the game is fun to play,4
"What have done to this game, everytime it says network error, I have a 50mbps speed wifi. It is not recognizing the network. I loved this game so much Please please fix this guys?",2
Love it!!! Y'all's best work yet! Only fps worth playing on mobile!!!! Just wish it would quit loading me into games already halfway finished and I'm never on the winning end. Not cool guys.,5
The game is great if you have an eternity to wait for it to load! The game takes up 7.7GB of storage and is very glitchy. Other than that it's a pretty cool game.,2
"Every time I update,the downloading is done 100% , then what happens I don't know. My full internet pack got wasted every time. Its very annoying, far nothing related to realistic gaming",1
Everything is good except those updates. I am playing this game from starting then app size was 10gb and now it's almost 4.5gb in total .And we have to download whole files in each update why? You should provide only new things in each update not whole app and data.,3
Its a good game. Please add replay feature so content creators can watch and download their gameplay as it is in free fire and pubg has feature where u can watch best moments of your gameplay. It will help a lot of content creators.,4
This is annoying you have to wait 2 hours at strat have have you to login but like roblox you could spam and the ai too easy and don't has a difficulty and there's a bug tricking the game if you log on a different mine reset would include even on that account it's gone,1
Too much lag after every new season and update. I don't have high end device but 8 gb ram and snapdragon 720g should be enough to run this game. Please fix it asap or I have to switch to another game (pubg most probably),5
"everytime i open the game it takes long time to connect,connection problem ,timeout,authorization error 581200,waiting for connection although the internet speed is very good all the time.",1
Don't waste your time. Plenty of mods and cheats. Pay tonwin guns that cost over 100$ then u can win constantly. When I got mine my kd went up a whole 1.0 it's crazy. Still wish I had not spent 100 dollars on a stupid gun. Also matchmaking well lol it sucks,1
"Yep it was a very nice game ever because this game having smooth rotation and movements, extreme graphics ya I like this game and this game deserve 5 rate and the only thing is that u can't play low end divice that's a fact.",5
"Best game and the graphics are really amazing and the fps if also great and there are too many game modes in it and it is really a nice game and gives us a amazing experience and time pass game you cant understand that 1-2 hours are gone you forget all the things when you play this amazing ,great,super,best,better, excellent,great,nice all. üëçüëçüëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüê≤üê≤üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòÖ",5
Great Game for mobile but lets see how technology advances nd reaches to the point where mobile graphics will literally look like pcs realistic blissim.,5
I love this game very much because there's tons of modes and maps. Even tons of guns. It's very fun and entertaining. I recommend downloading this very fun game!,5
There is this message that pops up when i try to login : insufficient storage or something like that. However i have 60gb of free storage on my phone ??!!,2
Hi Call of Duty . By mistake I delete my call of duty game and after again installing it I logined again but it is saying I have not an account but I have It is again and again logging as guest please fix it Activison . Regards Activision,5
Changing my comments call of duty gaming is the best ever to see a better üôå picture live gaming so people can challenge each other around the world or team up and more like recon mode or hunted and Rescue mission that will be awesomer if that would be awesomeness,5
This game recently is starting to suck. Everytine e new update is up you have to wait to download everything again. Whats the poind on having a 15 GB game on your phone and everytime there is an update you have to redownload every resource? I think its time for me to pass to PUBG,3
I love the game it definitely brings back old memories i have of playing the older games but can you bring the game to Nintendo that would be amazing and more fun oh and can you put the map carrier from black ops 2 on here?,5
"Goodmorning mr sir My account has some how just magically disappeared, I have followed the steps provided by your website on more than one occasion, and am yet to recieve an e-mail to recover my account, I really love this game its amazing, and a very enjoyable experience, so this experience is very disappointing.... I truly hope my account will be restored and soon. Due to this, the game has lost 3 stars from my point of view, and thats even more disappointing. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Kind regards",2
I love this characters and game but most some things should has want to change its get most glitches or bugs in the match and weapons should has to upgrade properly...... Please do this in the update..........,3
It's a good game it just when you get Gold you would wanna get diamond which means you would have to get around 10 kills 150 times in a completed match can you please change it to 50 or 80 to make it easy please it's a very good game tho,5
Pretty fun but has an update every time you blink and they'll just add a flower in the corner of the map and one gun will get a mini tweak and Activision made it so that's a statement in it of its self.,4
"Everything is good, but when ever the game starts. It takes more than 5 minutes to load every thing. That is irritating man. Fix that.",3
"The Call of Duty series used to be a legend. Pure hardcore. Its painfull to see how you guys have now roped in human-dogs, mummies and what not and made a mockery out of the COD series. You guys at the team really need to do some course correction. I used to feel like a soldier when I played your game. Sadly, now i feel like a cartoon or a fantasy creature from wonderland. Its for the team to decide whether they want to keep the legacy or the short term monetary gains.",3
"Listen Call Of Duty I know y'all can do better, I gotta redownload the game and all the extra in game content every single time I close out the game, I have to uninstall CoD Mobile, and do it all over again, fix the app YO!",2
I don't usually play online games. I love playing offline games but this game has something special that I can't stop playing. I never liked Pubg or BGMI but I can surely say that I love this COD Mobile game a lot. Hats off to you developers üëçüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
After the most recent update... No matter what network I connect to the lag is beyond comprehension. Ping is stuck at 200ms doesn't drop or increase!!!!,1
This game used to be one of my top favs .... I had to uninstall it due to error messages with-in game ... Now am not able to reinstall it ... Anyone facing the same issue ? Any fixes ?,1
"Not played it yet but all cod games r good so 5stars, edit: a few months later I've played it now for like I dunno 4 months lol . It is pretty good if there wz 6stars I'd give it 6 stars. I hate the draws tho edit5: i still hate the draws i get only skins no gun cmon guys but the game been working fine nothings wrong lol",5
"So...while it is playable and ""fun"". The monetization is awful. I mean, what do you expect from Activision? Also, it's pay to win. So if you don't pay and buy all the ridiculous stuff the game forces you to buy, you will be at a disadvantage.",1
"I'm giving it a 3star bcoz the last update was so bad I can't even play a game. Every time I try to log in it kept on saying ""timeout"" or ""authentication fail"".",3
The games horrible gotdam it takes away points from me even when i get a victory. And its getting really annoying it puts me by my slef when i play battle royal and i check and fill squad was on and duos was on and it still puts me single,3
This game crashes on me in the middle of Battle Royale matches. It really sucks to be in the middle of the match only to suddenly have your game crash.,2
This game is really awesome but there is a lot of bots coming in battle royale. Pushing Lagendry is quite easy. So please increase points for legendary up to 20k and add one more step to legendary like Dominator or something.,4
"I've had this game a while and I always enjoy it but the customer services are the worst, none of you are helping, my account is being used and destroyed by a hacker and none of you are helping me, I keep asking for help and still no help, what's the point of continuing this, I loved this game and spent money on it but none of you can help me, now a hacker removed me from my clan, removed all my friends and messes up all my setting and yet none of you can help me Thanks üëç",1
"It freezes: can't move, shoot, or even change weapons. Other than this, it is a fun game to play.",4
"1,5 hrs to download season 3 update ! I would like to know how many mercenaries and soldiers dress in pink and purple clothing with rifles that match !! Give the game at least a bit of dignity to those that really serve !",3
Had a system update on my phone now cod isnt getting past validating my info . Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. But only let me play till i got off game for the day and now back to square one please help !,3
"Awesome game. I would like to know will you add again option to get Balkan Special ATU operator, Serbian and many other people would like to see again that operator for sure. Make Bundle or something please. Greetings.",5
"Great game all the download problems are sorted and I injoy playing everyday, if I have one issue it's the luck game you never win a good gun I'm guessing you need to spend pure money to get it.if you could give it every now and again for low C would be awesome",5
I like this game more the graphics is so nice there is lot of multiplayer modes but one thing I want is zombie mode because of the graphics and colors,4
I recently started playing COD on my Samsung Galaxy A70 smart phone and I have a problem ...my game doesn't just start anymore I uninstalled and installed and still it just stops on screen saying error in Google download It's frustrating I haven't played COD in 3 months cause of this,2
Its worst now there are too much downloads inside game and now from last 3 days my account is not opening because of some authentication error ... I tried many things to resolve it but now its frustrated me ... Worst Experience ...,1
This game is lit graphics is a zillion point and the new ideas are so good you understand the people playing the game. I mean there is no other shooting game that is better than call of duty I love the game üíØ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°,5
At first I played this game in java mobile and it is very good experience than java. I love the game very much and controls are very good. This game is really fantastic on medium graphics,5
"Please, please, please, make it support mouse and keyboard. It's such a great game and it's really sad to not play it with mouse and keyboard. PC players can play it with mouse and keyboard so why can't we?!",5
Great game cant stop playing. Love that you can customize the buttons. Dosen't lag much but dosen't lower my rating I recommend it.,5
"This game is amazing i only have one issue with it that i have downloaded this game previously my experience was good with it than i deleted this game for some reason and now i downloaded this game and it is stil good but only one thing is ruining my experience is the network connection problem i have a good internet connection,When i open the game it always loads or it says internet connection problem. Please! Fix this ""internet connection"" problemü•∫üò≠i really want to enjoy this game again.",4
"Pay to win game, lots of hackers, support doesn't care about hackers. Unless you wanna pay, you might lose alot. Also, check multiplayer mode how many mods are there. Doesn't believe me ? Download the game and check yourself. ‚ôß‚ô§..",1
Good and exceptional game good graphics but takes a lot of space and needs a lot of data which is a mild frustration and took me about 2h to 3h to download it otherwise it's a good game,3
I'm playing this game since it released and I'd love to tell you all that it's the best game ever like pubg and free fire like kids playing games. I love this game but there some glitches and hackers in game which make the game awful but overall this is the best game....,5
If you have a problem. For example your account gets hacked. There is no one you can contact for help. They give out player personal information as well.,1
Honestly disappointed they removed zombies. I really likes it and yea they could've did better on the graphics but please put zombies back on the cod mobile,2
This game sucks so bad that Activision can't even do a game the best. The guns are so unbalanced that your rage in one minute. Way too many sweats. A lot of campers. Stupid over powered score streak,2
I like this game infact I play this more then my ps5 but ranked has gotten boring what I mean is the rank reset same all over again and again when they should make this like black ops 1 15 prestige levels get cool skull üíÄ for your rank as u go up problem with this game is the amount of points u lose to makes anyone not want to play ranked its become more frustrating then fun and no new change in ranked it needs a complete overhaul in my opinion,5
Literally on the verge of deleting this game. When will you guy's fix that footsteps bug in BR? Can't hear any footsteps of my opponent & not everyone can be a ninja user in a team so why can't I hear any footstep? This bug has been around for years. Can't wait to shift myself to #ApexLegends,1
"Great, love playing it however please add a controller filter for teaming up i hate joining people and them kicking me over and over because i have a controller connected.",4
This has nothing to relate with the game it's just can you slow down the ram because the ram is broken I tried to get all the operators I mean like The operators and it won't let me because it was like oh you mean more storage 100 GB and it wasn't full it's still something,5
Hey guys I am facing issue from yesterday onwards while entering into the room after clicking start button after some couple of seconds it's throwing loading time error. So please look into this i am using Android 11 Sorry guys i am uninstalling this app it's frustating,3
"At this rate I hope that the game will die, 3 guns in the whole of ranked,random ping spikes, NO weapon Balancing, Promotes sniper camping, every new gun added is the new meta. WTH IS THIS GAME I've been playing the game since it's launch and left around April 2021 but after I came back in aug, BOOM old guns are useless, 2 gun meta etc Ive spent around 50$ in the game but to no avail as those guns are useless",5
"Don't buy anything from spins or crates, I have been playing for years I've spent hundreds of dollars easy and I've never and I mean never got a mythic or legendary, YOU WILL NEVER GET IT UNLESS YOU BUY EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON THE SPIN IT IS EXTREMELY RIGGED AND MONEY HUNGRY PLEASE DONT BUY ANYTHING ITS A HUGE WASTE, IM NOT SPENDING ANOTHER DOLLAR UNTIL YOU GIVE ME ONE OR I JUST EARN CREDITS. Why I've spent about a grand easy and nothing I quit not one decent item in the game. You don't respect us.",1
Straight garbage load into a match and then it kicks me out of the match and kicks me out of the whole app makes me want to delete the app and never play again fix this garbage or lose a good player,1
The forced tutorial is idiotic. Just let me play the game I'll figure it out myself. Especially since I done it before. For some reason I've had to restart from scratch üôÑ,4
Here is a real review not those complaints you see almost all through the comments complaining about thier graphics maybe they just need a better phone the game is high end for people who enjoy mobile gaming i have played since the very beginning and bought almost all the game passes i have never had connection problems or ping strikes or bad graphics experiences so those who say that is probably playing ons some cheap low end phone like oppo or mobicel or something cheap sorry to if offended,5
This game is awful do not put any money into it I spent well over 40 dollars on one crate and got everything but the weapon now I have to spend another 25 for the gun? No thanks,1
"This is not fair,i mean the game is good and all but how can i re-download what has been downloaded its not suppose to be that way i got all my maps and now am going to re-download all over again because of an update.",4
Used to love it .still better than PUBG but.all the downloads and loading times not to mention all the bugs it still has now even after the updates this game takes up 20 gigs on my fone and takes forever to load .starting to want to uninstall it,2
"So clearly America is getting it's seasons released way later than other places some people are already on season four or beyond, I just got to season 3, someone told me I was getting hacked I asked what they mean and they said I'd see soon enough his name was monkeybutts. I also got a letter about joining some sort of ground forces? I don't even see it as an option on mine.",2
This is not just a game This is the game of the year if you think about it then play and be amazed at how it always changes to make it more fun with every month you getting stuff just for playing and if you login everyday you get even more it is the best game I have love this,5
"Stuck at 99% loading ""getting version info.."". On fully updated Galaxy S10 with fully updated game connected to 5G router with 500mbps speeds. Good job",1
The game really good but the new maiaim map it's not good at all. It's always boring and there's not real action. Still love the game. Am a huge fan of Call of duty franchise,4
"My 5 starts rate was made at 1/16/20 Now I take it back, since season 4 this game have been going downhill, it started with cheaters, hackers, and exploiters. Then the latency issues started to appear and at least this is fixed by 50%, it could be lower and spike-less. Lately bots non-logical aim and headshot accuracy is making players go nuts. Recently we've been suffering since the first mythic weapon M13 appeared, and this has been going since then. This game became worse than the beginning.",5
"My favourite game came back to haunt me. After spending money on weapons and on my account, now there aren't even any replies to my mails. Can't login to my account. Is there anyone who can help please.",1
This game is awsome. I do have one suggestion tho (you guys probably won't see this or do this but just putting it put there) you should add a campaign mode like alot of other Cod games,5
Hello Activision I love your game but please bring back original zombies that we had in 2019 I forgot what you think but I think it was 2019 just bring please bring back the original okay a lot of people will like to play it just please bring it back the zombies we have right now I don't know you like it doesn't feel right for like a mobile title you know and the zombies we have right now is closest we've ever gotten to an actual zombies for call of duty so please bring it back,4
"This game is much better now that many fixes were done. I only gave 4 stars because i win every match as the mvp, therefore i think im playing against bots and not real people even though im playing ranked matches. But even if its against bots i still love this game. Its better than most of the console versions",4
"The game is fun, graphics are good, I just don't like when I'm in the middle of a match and all of a sudden it cuts off and I have to start over, that's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5",4
"They are giving very good graphics and another excelerating game modes . '' Thank u CALL OF DUTY for giving us entertainment throw the game"" . Thank you so much .........",5
"Why is the game relaunching wepons? I thought the pdw was supposed to be a p90, but they put an actual p90, I thought msmc was supossed to be a ingram, but they put it again put something that makes more sense, like an makarov or maybe allow modification on launchers but overall the game is more compact, less laggy and more reliable, without having it crash every br game still I wish I could control better what to download, not having every blue skin I don't use downloaded on my cellphone",5
"Mostly good. Nice maps, graphics, gameplay. One major issue though: too many bots in multiplayer.",4
I don't know if undead siege ended but I cant find it in main menu but I was just able to play by accidents when there was an email reward about a shard for zombie mode,4
"The download process after each update is time consuming. But, all in all a great way to relieve stress while taking a dump.",4
"The game is so good and amazing but there is something that I want to add,this thing is finishing like in warzone,if you added this i will be so happy and excited, i hope you guys see this and look in this case, thanks",4
SUCKS! NOT FAIR FOR üéÆ PLAYERS Why can't we participate in the tournaments? Why is snoop dog crate the hardest one to gain the skin ü§î Can't play rank match. Liked the game but a huge change of heart after the patch for controllers.,1
"Really cool game, everytime I'm bored, I just play COD Mobile, also a great way to pass timeüëç. One thing I do want is the old Zombies, I really enjoyed it.",5
"After update, can't download anything in game. Like the maps and skins. My game immediately crashes. 10/10 cod experience",2
I love this game except for the high requirements to play and the amount of sweats in matches but otherwise it's only pay to look good not p2w you can bring for anything in the game.,5
Good game for multiplayer.... But for battle royal it's not good... Very small map in battle royal and class ruined the experience of battle...make a simple battle Royal game only gun fight not class not anything.... 3 on 3 for for multiplayer but 0 for battle Royal.....,3
"Since updating the game freezes or blackscreen. Click on support, did everything thing they said to troubleshoot and still having issues. Please help me......",2
"The game is great, but I don't want to download the same map every couple days, game is 90% downloading resources, initializing and downloading assets, all for a quick game.",1
"My mobile ping comes a lot more.As a result, I could not play the game.Please fix the problem as soon as possible.Earlier when I was playing Battle Royale my phone had a PIN of 40 to 50.But is currently seen above 150.Which is very frustrating.I hope you solve the problem as soon as possible and give me a chance to play fair games.",2
I did have a 5 star review but for the last week or so. The game keeps freezing. All the players freeze and u cant even play the game.,1
I love the game definitely five stars. Just question can you put Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger in the game but overall it's really sweet game absolutely love it can't wait for season 3 üòÅüòÅ,5
It was a brilliant experience playing it.the fact I like about it is that it is compatible with all phones even it's a low end phone or high end phone,5
Recently got an SD card for my phone so I can download more games and now COD Mobile won't work now because of Facebook Authorization error. Please for the love of God do something to fix this issue immediately.,3
Very poor game instead of playing this i wanna play mario the oldest version the worst game i have ever seen the server has too much glitch the loading is endless and no management of this game.,1
Absolutely horrible I would give it a 5 star but the reason is that went I try to play on celler data and have a good connection it has a big bug and I can't play it and it works only of wifi activition Fix this,1
"This game gets worse the more you play it, seriously. This game is made to trigger the deepest anger at all costs. The devs should be ashamed of these latest patches. It never fails no matter what device I play on, the slightest tilt or bump will make the screen flip upside down uncontrollably. I uninstalled and will NEVER install again. This game has serious balancing issues in the matchmaking and they will never be fixed.",1
"I just wish those that make the game would be honest, and not say it's the best things since sliced bread when it's not, and not pay people to put good reviews ! Need new guns and not new camouflage!",3
Would not recommend I have lost 2 accounts and I paid big money for skins this game is a scam!!! I suggest PUBG have had an account for many years have not lost an account. PLEASE READ BEFORE PLAYING!!!!,1
"We miss activision üò¢. Since microsoft aquired the company or runs like windows 95 full of bugs and more! Game engine quality is in the dumpster. Weapons like M-13, Type 25, PP90, M16, are OP. High aler and alert seriously!! Not to mention all the ü§ë spent on weapons the Jax shotgun gets nerferd in under 1 week. #freecallofdutymobileü™¶",3
Hey I love this game and I know if anyone leaves a bad review there either are real bot or Fortnite kids but when ever I am playing It log's me out and it is annoying also bring back the old zombie map not the BR version the old one like the one at the beginning was the best so can you bring that back but if not fix the loging out pls,5

New Update Graphics of BATTLE is Very Boredüòëüòëüòë They corrected it there have two maps and but also there have small changes from the old one graphic look like exact same for PUBG's graphics I like old one it feel like really,4
Since the last update it is horrible. I can't even enjoy the game as a low rank player because it throws me in with the highest ranked players. Fix it,1
My fav game. But I keep getting time off it error and no one can help me fix problem it's been a week now and I still can't play. Can anyone please help?,1
"Dont know what has happened now, it doesnt work on wifi anymore..I have to use cellular data .. I have tried re-installing it several times but still it isnt working",2
There are some net issues even on WiFi & there are some lags for few modes & a few bugs. Please fix it.,2
"New update is absolutely mess, strom in the game and time taken when starting game may be a bug, Activision please have a look at this issue.",1
Fu**ing. Annoying tried connecting wireless controller to it and I did then U headed in to a game and both joy sticks did not work,1
"Why am I playing against players that are way advanced than me. I have been playing for 2 years and as soon as I updated this time, other players are out of my league. Wasn't like this before. I was really enjoying this game before. Idk, Maybe it's just me.",3
"Totally its fantastic But u are really weak about banning cheaters and hackers from interrupting ""Fareplay"" Also so bad at removing accounts using usernames with verbal abuse and insults! And of course shotguns are way to powerful and thats bad; make it weak a little :( And plz make at least one free legendary weapon for us to get! And finally i think u should change ur bp rewards routines and the voice of captain in battle royal! Anyway ur still the bestü§ç",5
"Call of Duty Mobile is a fantastic game, i just wish that they would add 120 fps support for all phones with a 120hz display, it's really unacceptable that the Galaxy S20 Ultra has it but the S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra don't. Come on Activision and Timi please fix this.",4
"I wish enough SA players would comment we need servers in SA. 90ms in randoms is okay but in ranked MP it's just not. The game is awesome no doubt, now imagine how smooth it'll be with 10ms or 50ms at least. Lol SA players can't, just because the game feels smooth on your end doesn't mean your inputs are registered, players with low ping will always have an edge over you. This game aint that hard when you have low ping, everyone is a pro with 10ms right. We want servers in South Africa CODM.",5
After the recent update game hangs quite a lot and during crucial moments. Size of the game is atrocious and comparable to pc games. Really regretting wasting time and money in this game,2
"My game will not auto login and it will be telling me login timeout try again later, I have deleted the game two times and downloaded it again and after some days it will give me the same error again please fix.the game cos the game.its so interesting my user name there is BABAGBESE THERE IS NO OTHER USER USING THIS NAME ANY WHERE IN THIS GAME PLEASE HELP COS O CANT LOGIN IN HELP ME TO LOGIN SO I CANT RATE it",1
I just love it full-of action but now I can't play a decent game with out glitches and getting out into matches that's already started and game is freezing up please fix,5
it is funny how the devs and tencent seems to fail at stopping people from spawn killing you in ranked matches its not fun when your own teammate is a alt or clan member of the oppsoing team and they sit there and feed the enemy all the while having to dodge being shot at before you even respawn because you respawn by the teammate who is just standing there ignorant clan system makes the whole game play unbearably boring then you have clans telling you you have to play this way get rid of clans,1
Great controller compatible game. No complaints apart from the occasional excessive loading screen.,5
Network connection too bad during the game. It is better to improve the network connection of the game a little. Which was very good 2 years ago,3
"This game is full of hackers and cheaters. People fly around, never die, jump ridiculously high and penetrate walls. The developers doesn't do anything about it. Lame.",1
My game keeps freezing for the past 4 months I tried everything after I deleted it we got it on my tablet nothing works I changed tablets too even went back to the old cell phone and nothing works can one of the call of duty tech people help please it's been 5 months I can't play any game I keep getting thrown out I still give you five stars I love the game I had it for 2 years but now it's lagging for the past five months need a little help,5
"It is a good game but there are a lot of toxic players and hackers, beside that for being too good your account will get banned for 10 years also the persistence perk in ranked matches are very annoying",3
Another simple game for 10 year old kids with all the arrows pointing on where to click and there's no other option than doing what the arrow tells you. üòÑüòÑüòÑ No offense but an amateur game,1
My data erased. I mad a lot progress in the game and after it was logged with FB account and I am not able to restore my old level. How can I do this?,1
"It's the best game.. but y'all really need to take these BOTS out of the games, it's messing up every match that others have been in..... please fix this..... other than that I love it... just please take the bots out...",5
"Nice game infact best game but Game freezes alot with this latest update, crashes and ontop of that the size is 2gb when you download, 4gb on installing and then I don't know how it got to 7.2gb. Please review a mobile game...... getting to size of a PC game",4
"Probably the best game ever played....it is better than pubg,bgmi and free fire....and the updates are awsome love this game...its so addictive...i can say that this is cod modern warfare pocket edition...(mobile) X D...... X ...D",5
5 star down to 1. The jumping and sliding spam in this game is getting beyond the joke. Please add a delay between being able to jump and slide every god damn millisecond.,1
"Great game the graphics are very high for a mobile game too but members of the f2p community like me have a problem.we cant afford karambits,folding knives or assault knife so instead of filling all of them into base melee blueprint,karambit folding knife and assault knife should be seperate unlockable weapons.and the blueprints obtained earlier will be seperated eg. Karambit-piercing hawk will be in karambits blueprint. Other than that.. D13 sector needs a buff but overall its the best game",5
Please help me. The game keeps logging me off and telling me it's reconnecting but it's still the same. I promise if you help me I'll give it a 5 star because I really love this game.,1
"This New Update For CODM Is On Fire! This New Update Is Totally Incredible & Now Has An Extremely Smoothie Style Of Game Play. This New Update Is Impeccably Laggy-Free. So I'd Like ¬≤ Say ThankYou ¬≤ All Of Programmers & Whom Else-Ever Made This Possible 4 Us ¬≤ Enjoy. This New Update Was Very Much Necessary & Now That This New Update Is Available ¬≤ Us, It Can Finally Show All Of Its Gifted Essentials. This New Update Is Definitely Gonna Unlock All Of CODM True Potential & Make The Game Fun ¬≤ Play",5
This is garbage you expect people to download it right here it said 2.2gb and it is 5 gb you wasted my space just like you have wasted your game potential and the thing is so laggy and i am using Samsung galaxy S21 so it you ge fault it is to late for this game. If you are looking for a better games go for modern combat,1
Other a great game but stop making us spend hundreds to get a cool skin if I pay for in game skin I wan to buy a bundle with no gambling I think of yall did it like the console code and make it where you can buy a full bundle with the gaming it would be better.,4
"I've been having SO MUCH trouble lately. My game isn't connecting... It will log me of right in the middle of the game, and I loose my xp cards over it .",1
Its glitching way to much half the time u can't even get a shot in cuz the gsme wants to glitch and u caunt even geta shot fired cuz it freeze to dam much plz fix if couuld give the game no stars i whould this game its got to the point u caint do nun to rank up without it glitch way to much,1
What the hell is this game? Daily asks for update and opens in much more time. I am going to uninstall it. I liked it more than pubg mobile before but now its the worst game because of its loading and updates.,1
One of the best mobile action games have played... graphic game play everything is gudd.. but unfortunately it sucks sometime.. Lots of bugs these days especially in BR.. In TPP mode soldier comes after few seconds of game starts,5
Managed to pull the game up from in between with amazing draws and optimization. The new BR system and continuous additions to MP make the gun super fun and engaging,4
"Good, I get network connection issues occasionally that have nothing to do with my network connection, idk what thats about. Also, bring back zombies permanently.",4
"3rd review-Now the size is 14.5 GB... 2nd review-Reducing from 4 star to one star, due to size now its occupied 13.5 GB in my mobile... 1st review-Gameplay, graphics are good. But this game lack physics like aiming, jumping. need more soldiers customisation free of cost...",1
Pretty pissed off I spent over 50$ and didn't get anything good out of the draws. Didn't get snoop or the girl on the other draw. I don't think I will be doing any more purchase.,1
Good but when my phone flips i have to leave the game because I can't shoot because the fire buttons are gone even on tanks and and car that has a weapon. Please fix this.,4
Controller issue has been fixed! YEEEEEESS why the hell it took 3 1/2 months is beyond me cme on guys do better. But ty for the fix and watch out for hackers they are one the loose.,4
Why are we forced to download maps that are for non-ranked? This game is getting sick with every update. 8gb is way too much. Atleast add option to delete useless maps.,1
The game is so fun but I gave it a three because every time I log in to my account it starts to load and as soon as I'm going to go and play it says timeout I don't know what it means but in the future I will give you a 5 star,3
It kicks me out of the game theirs no signal lack of audio and its to slow it glitches too much i havent played not one full round withaut it kicking me out this sucks bad.,1
It is the best game ever i have ever had but the thing is the reason why i give 4star is the players are very fast even i could not possibly target the players and if you get this text pls make the slower speed a little alittle only,4
It is good. But I am not able to increase graphic quality of the game even I downloaded the hd graphic resource please do something for it.,4
There's nothing lime a few rounds of cod to help a guy sleep. Or not sleep and just be killen Matha f@kas all night long! Youcandoit!!!. Game is amazing control's are unbelievable. Excellent work dev`s plz make it possible for cod coin collection without purchase. Ask you're ad team to make a video balance for us if you will. Long as the revenue is coming in to support the behind the scenes and development team's for our continued enjoyment and ur income . Provide the option they'll figure itout,4
Absolutely trash. You can't even play ranked with such high ping..instead of contunuesly upgrading the game and making it take massive space. Why don't yourll atleast sort the south African server out.,1
Why all this unnecessary downloads. I mean just to update this app is to huge. And besides this game is quietly kicking out phones of 2-3 gb ram which would make many players loose interest in this game. Pls fix this issue.,1
