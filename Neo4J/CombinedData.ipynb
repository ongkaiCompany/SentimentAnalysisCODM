absolutely take cowboy mafia  as usual i m going to drop some bug information and some gameplay feedback thoughts  hope that you all have a great day    mythic spectre      i m putting this at the top of my list since it s a bit infuriating to see that no changes have been made here    when will mythic spectre get a unique execution    all three mythic characters are roughly       why is the very first one still missing a custom execution   players like myself invested in your new  and very expensive  mythic characters when spectre was first released  we re now on mythic character number   yet spectre still doesn t have a custom execution  the second templar got a custom execution there should have been an update giving one to spectre it is absolutely unacceptable for a       skin to be missing features for so long that it s two sibling skins have  this has to change     br       jackal    we drastically need custom layout controls for the jackal    jet  the jackal was released on june   th  well over a year ago  yet we still can t customize our button layouts  for reference  it took one battlepass season for the tank to get its own custom layout controls and mere weeks for the christmas tree event to get a button addition not having this option massively hurts your players who either play with thumbs only or who have disabilities  i have a friend who only has one hand and plays br  it s impossible for him to even take off in the jet because of the locked layout    the jackal targeting system bug is still present   where using your class skill  even in pre game lobby  removes the player targeting white squares from the jackal     the bug where the jackal will occasionally not do damage with its main machine gun is actually far more prominent than i first realized  if you jump out of the plane as soon as the match starts there s nearly a   in   chance of your jackal not doing damage with the machine gun  i did find a work around for this which is to restart your game  switching jets will not fix this problem  you must restart the app   note  this game restart fix will not work for resolving the missing white targeting squares      using the quick strike skill and landing on top of near your teammates tags will prevent you from picking the tags up  you have to walk     meters away and then walk back to the tags to grab them     i won t speculate as to why alcatraz was removed but i would like to ask if there will be major or minor map changes in br  it s been a while since we saw any location updates    the flyswatter profile achievement will not progress when you knock someone mid air and they fall to the ground  i ve knocked many bots and even killed some on alcatraz yet the achievement never progresses  please look into this     my final note for br is that i m very happy to see lobbies filled up again with the    second pre game lobby  honestly i don t care how long i have to wait as long as i m not dropped in a boring bot lobby  so awesome job with those changes     multiplayer      have you considered adjusting the hardline perk so that it makes scorestreaks cost     less instead of adding     points to a player s score  both ranked mp and tournament mode base your ranking point rewards off of your scoring position  a perk shouldn t allow you to tip the scoring system in your favor so that you ll be rewarded with more ranked tournament points  everyone should be playing on equal footing for score positioning     we have   many   mp maps in the game that are currently being unused in ranked  ranked seasons typically use less than   of our overall maps  it would be really refreshing to see ranked mp have more maps introduced into its rotation  variety is the spice of life and mp ranked is far too bland     zombies undead siege     thank you for fixing the aether camo completion with the spear     any updates on a new map for og zombies    crates  strongboxes  lucky boxes       crates have been killed off in lieu of lucky boxes and strong boxes  strong boxes take   bronze    silver and   gold ticket per draw  but we can t even select what type of ticket gets used first  if you have a bronze ticket then that s what is consumed first just like the removal of bundles  you guys are killing off crates  you ve also now minimized the impact of gold silver bronze tickets  why should anyone buy your monthly weekly passes now that you re phasing out their main use  i find this to be a disgusting transition away from a purchase draw system that  while not perfect  at least gave players fair options at reasonable prices    credit store      we still can t search for charms only via a tab in the credit store  i genuinely hate having to scroll down to find things in one tiny column  the previous grid system was much more efficient      this game doesn t have any solid systems in place for acquiring credits through gameplay  i d love to see the credit system changed for the long term health of this game many fps games reward players with f p in game currency for completing matches  codm does not     clan wars      very happy to see that we can now host    players within the clan  it was an unexpected and welcome surprise      in closing   despite a few glaring issues i think that codm is in a pretty healthy state right now  it would be nice to see some more major updates to br maps  vehicles and then mp ranked games getting their map pools expanded  overall though i think that the game is doing well but just a little stagnant  i also appreciate that everyone on the codm team has been trying to be more transparent with the players and keeping us updated on things   even if the timing of those updates comes a little late   thank you for another exciting season and your
